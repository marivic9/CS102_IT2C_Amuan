"1","10. Dune: Part Two","her5066","10/10","26 February 2024","This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible."
"2","10. Dune: Part Two","AfricanBro","9/10","26 February 2024","Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.""Power over spice is power over all""- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was ""game of thrones in space"", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind ""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi."" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the ""water of life"" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it."
"3","10. Dune: Part Two","and_mikkelsen","10/10","28 February 2024","This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!Now I am gonna watch this movie again, and maybe again! Then I am gonna read the books!"
"4","10. Dune: Part Two","HalBanksy","10/10","4 March 2024","A monumental piece of cinema. And combined with Part 1, we have one of the greatest adaptations in genre literature history.It's clear everyone on set was aware that they were working on something special here - because literally every single person in this production have brought their A-Game for a truly incredible technical achievement. And easily the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring.Paced to perfection, at once uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking and beyond THRILLING. Dave Bautista fights someone to the death, while hanging onto the outside of a helicopter that is being shot out of the sky - and that doesn't even reach the Top 10 action set-pieces in the film.. It just doesn't get better than this."
"5","10. Dune: Part Two","Dvir971","10/10","26 February 2024","Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended."
"6","10. Dune: Part Two","Ellimof","10/10","26 February 2024","If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol."
"7","10. Dune: Part Two","poseyfan","10/10","1 March 2024","""Dune"" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve."
"8","10. Dune: Part Two","awessel-58117","10/10","26 February 2024","This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every seen. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10."
"9","10. Dune: Part Two","HabibieHakim123","10/10","28 February 2024","In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timothée Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver."
"10","10. Dune: Part Two","Sleepin_Dragon","10/10","29 February 2024","Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.10/10."
"11","10. Dune: Part Two","her5066","10/10","26 February 2024","I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema."
"12","10. Dune: Part Two","AfricanBro","9/10","26 February 2024","I have to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first movie. I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment..."
"13","10. Dune: Part Two","and_mikkelsen","10/10","28 February 2024","Let's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public.."
"14","10. Dune: Part Two","HalBanksy","10/10","4 March 2024","For once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it.."
"15","10. Dune: Part Two","Dvir971","10/10","26 February 2024","The movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate..."
"16","10. Dune: Part Two","Ellimof","10/10","26 February 2024","The relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie..."
"17","10. Dune: Part Two","poseyfan","10/10","1 March 2024","An A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again."
"18","10. Dune: Part Two","awessel-58117","10/10","26 February 2024","Dune: Part Two is simply Denis Villeneuve's Magnum Opus in his filmography. I've loved this director's work since ""Blade Runner 2049"", and ""Arrival"". He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timothée Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired! There's so much to take away from this masterpiece! Definitely my #1 favorite movie of this year as of now! Bring on Dune: Part Three as fast as possible!"
"19","10. Dune: Part Two","HabibieHakim123","10/10","28 February 2024","Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film.I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras.This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically. Like I stated in the beginning, see this film!"
"20","10. Dune: Part Two","Sleepin_Dragon","10/10","29 February 2024","As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer."
"21","10. Dune: Part Two","her5066","10/10","26 February 2024","We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor . The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD."
"22","10. Dune: Part Two","AfricanBro","9/10","26 February 2024","I just watched this in IMAX and it was one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had. Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I'm instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good. The last fight was awesome as well. ""You fought well Atreides."""
"23","10. Dune: Part Two","and_mikkelsen","10/10","28 February 2024","Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed."
"24","10. Dune: Part Two","HalBanksy","10/10","4 March 2024","As an avid movie fan I see plenty of movies, many average, many bad, a few good and once in while great. But I use the word great scarcely. Dune 2 is better than great. Oppenheimer was a great movie but I wouldn't rush back to see it a second time in the near future. Dune 2, I would see it again tomorrow. The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year? I don't think so, best movie of a generation is more akin to what I saw. Wish I could give it 11 stars."
"25","10. Dune: Part Two","Dvir971","10/10","26 February 2024","Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts."
"26","10. Dune: Part Two","Ellimof","10/10","26 February 2024","I just watched the pre-premiere of part two of Dune. It was a very good adaption of the books but not what totally what I expected. At the end the movie strayed away from the book which made me a bit sad to be honest. Especially the part (which is very important in the book-storyline) is the fact that the sister of Paul wasn't born yet when the film came to it's conclusion. Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end. Part one definitely did follow the book... part two also till the midst of the film. Still I strongly recommend to watch it... it is a must-see movie and ranks as one of my alltime favorites already."
"27","10. Dune: Part Two","poseyfan","10/10","1 March 2024","Lawrence of Arabia without the depth.The pacing was the problem.It was far too slow for the first 3/4 then rushed at the end.It meandered with little sense of what the point was at times.Chalamet just became a megalomaniac quite abruptly with very little development.And there was no surprise that he was going to become a messiah.His big challenge of riding a sand worm - ""the biggest ever seen"" (of course) - was predictably successfulWhy was Jessica chosen to be the Fremen mother superior when outsiders were so distrusted?Too little explanation, even though there was plenty of time to do so.Baron Harkonnen became quite ineffectual.The Emperor seemed a quite feeble old man.Where did his power come from?His fighters seemed quite average.He landed on the Arakkis and was defeated easily.I enjoyed Part 1 more because the characters were fresh and were more engaging.In Part 2 they seemed a little empty and caricatured. Part 2 seemed more of a grind.But, even so, I did enjoy it and will probably enjoy it more on 2nd watching.Zendaya was excellent.So was FergusonThe exploration of religion, fanaticism, freedom fighting vs terrorism, was interesting and unusual for a sci-fi movie. It does stand head and shoulders above most blockbusters.Of course, the visuals were stunning, as was the teeth-rattling sound.Although I admire the Director's more measured approach, i.e. Not just churning out a sequel, I'm not sure I'm excited enough for a part 3."
"28","10. Dune: Part Two","awessel-58117","10/10","26 February 2024","I couldn't see Christopher Walken as embodying a character in this. I only saw Christopher Walken as Christopher Walken.And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND. They could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play Irulan.Also the movie feels like an episode more than the conclusion of a two-part movie. I can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the Dune novels. So if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you, that is the best explanation I can give to you in your time of cinematic need.Otherwise, the film is entertaining for its length. Lots of good cinematography, music, etc."
"29","10. Dune: Part Two","HabibieHakim123","10/10","28 February 2024","I mean, yeah, it's very entertaining and, of course, very visually stunning. The set pieces, the cinematography, the use of visual effects and lights, the sound design and music, all, absolutely amazing and almost literally stunning!But then? I'm not really seeing much after that. As I have not read the books, this movie was a total mystery to me. There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books."
"30","10. Dune: Part Two","Sleepin_Dragon","10/10","29 February 2024","After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting.The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow.The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced.It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all.One of the best movies of 2024 for sure."
