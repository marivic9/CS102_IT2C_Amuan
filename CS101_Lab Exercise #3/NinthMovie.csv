"1","Mea Culpa","aprilsfriendorin","2/10","25 February 2024","I don't even know where to begin with this one. Right off the bat, the dialogue is ridiculous. Like, comically ridiculous. Within the first 15 minutes, I had to double check that this wasn't supposed to be a parody of thrillers. Like, how could someone write this and not intend it to be satirical? There's an evil mother in law that's so over the top, I'm convinced the writers just went to ChatGPT and asked it to write stereotypes. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if this entire script was AI-generated.The movie is worsened by unnecessary sex scenes and bad acting. Is it supposed to be an erotic thriller or a murder mystery? Pick one and do it well, don't try to do both and fail. The romantic male lead is such a bad actor, I was laughing at some of his line deliveries. Honestly the best thing about this movie was the mystery element, which was painfully predictable and trite. I gave it a two cause I guess it could be worse?"
"2","Mea Culpa","nikoyam","2/10","25 February 2024","I am truly beginning to believe that Tyler Perry understands that his achievements and ability to employ so many black actors/actresses and workers has struck such a cord of respect from Black America, that he knows that he'll never be cut off from us and continues to shovel out this crap. I am disheartened for Miss Kelly Rowland who deserved better than this and I am saddened to have to be so negative.This movie is full of the typical TP (Tyler Perry) tropes and overly written caricatures. He is such a poor writer and it continues to be seen in the poor quality of repugnant caricatures he creates. He doesn't know how to allow characters to be victimized without having to overly exaggerate the scenarios and people surrounding them for it to be possible.Mea (Kelly Rowland) is supposed to be high profile lawyer who is very good at what she does, yet we get nothing to build her as such. She spends most of her screen time being a skulking, moody shell of a woman who, for a lawyer, seems to leave her brain at home every time she crosses the doorway. We get no peek at her being a great lawyer, a wife or a friend. Everything just begins happening and her reactions to the unfolding of her life are always confusing and just plain DUMB!The cast of caricatures around her are as flat as a dollar bill. Zyair (Trevante Rhodes) is literally just in the movie to look sexy and talk slow. His character has no substance. Mea's husband (Sean Sagar) is flat and as usual, written to be so extremely uninvolved and weak that you can't like or dislike anything about him. The brother in law and Mother in law are extremely exaggerated as being insufferable (in order to make Mea look like a complete victim), but you get no reference as to why their relationship is like this or why they do what they do.This movie was supposed to be an erotic thriller and this seems to be the area where TP really put all of his energy (go figure). The interactions between Mea and Zyair are supposed to be sexy and seductive however, no seductive or alluring nature is given from Zyair that would make any married woman want to compromise her entire marriage for. Instead both individuals come off as dumb and just looking for excuses to have unwarranted and immoral sex. And the ""excuses"" (because that's what they are) that are mapped out via the plot are weak and watery at best. I also don't feel Mea's character showed enough interest to suddenly shift gears so suddenly the way she did. TP tried to make her this strong, unflinching woman who wasn't going to give in, so we never really saw her interested. (This is a miss both in the writing and the acting... Sorry Kelly.)For Background, the set design and environments are getting better than his movies of the past. But again, we are introduced to the TP prototypes: every actor/actress is stunning and in great shape. The homes they live in, cars they drive and clothes they wear are a stretch compared to their work or the financial situations they are supposed to be in and this all takes away from being able to take the movie seriously rather than seeing it as another TP stage play.Overall, the plot is predictable and full of tropes and holes. The writing is terribly poor and underwhelming. The characters are flat and snooze worthy. The acting is sub-par at best (a step above daytime soap operas) With the exception of Ronreaco Lee who plays Jimmy the PI. Ronreaco was a save in this film. You can tell he's a seasoned actor and he brought what little light to this film there was to be had. The ending offered nothing new or intriguing and TP needs to be stopped. But hey, at least we didn't get bad wigs eh?"
"3","Mea Culpa","seansoulo73","3/10","24 February 2024","Mea Culpa is another tragic attempt at filmmaking that's typical of Tyler Perry. I can't understand for the life of me why a man with all the resources at his disposal continues to make films like an amateur. I only got halfway through this BETesque project with absurd dialogue and pointless plot. From the beginning it was predictable that Tyler refuses to stray from his casting of pretty guys and attractive women. However, I wish Kelly Roland would have passed on this script and Trevante Rhodes too. His portrayals in Mike Tyson and Bruiser show his potential as a solid actor. This role did nothing for him, but add to Tyler's long list of casting hunky guys for his own eye candy I'm sure. Just look at all of his BET shows that follow the same casting formula.Let me get this right; a highly intelligent, married and successful defense attorney falls for the accused murderer client she's representing, who acts like an overtly demanding, arrogant, womanizing pig because he paints and sleeps with anything in a skirt and could potentially give her any kinda STD. Come on Tyler! But his core audience loves that kinda soap opera nonsense.I'm all for his success, but it would be refreshing to see Tyler get out of his own way and put some greenbacks behind developing and allowing other filmmakers an opportunity to tell their stories. Not just his own half hearted, written in a single weekend screenplays. He has a major roadblock when it comes to quality storytelling, character development, and filmmaking in general. He chooses quantity over quality, but he's said it works for his audience.I have literally only seen seven of his movies that I thought were decent, Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Why did I get married 1 and Too, the Family that Preys and Daddy's Little Girls, Good Deeds and Jazzman's Blues. I stopped watching anything with Madea in it after his second film featuring that character. That was all I needed.Bottom line is Netflix bought this latest TP dud, but that's not surprising either. Content is king, quality or not. Here's a thought, Tyler, let someone else write a film you direct or direct a film you write with creative license. Or just produce an awesome film directed and written by a talented filmmaker."
"4","Mea Culpa","garyvines-01290","4/10","24 February 2024","This movie is dull and put on. It has the feel of a Lifetime movie but less interesting. Kelly Rowland plays a supposed tough Chicago lawyer but her character doesn't translate the grit or depth that a tough lawyer character should have. She has only one note and an expressionless face. The only expression that helps her is when she smiles which she should play more roles that would allow that. And the lead actor.... Ug! He's terrible! He can't deliver a line to save his life! He doesn't come off like an artist at all, he comes off like a professional athlete attempting to deliver a line like a cheesy commercial. I lost interest way early on. The characters are all dimensionless, vapid and predictable. The story could have been better with the right actors and director but this one is awful. I'm going to try and finish it but I'm not interested enough to do so."
"5","Mea Culpa","ianuadrip","5/10","23 February 2024","This is yet another thriller with extremely stupid characters doing extremely stupid things. It is impossible for me to empathize with complete idiots who get involved in a dangerous and immoral sexual relationship with their client, without any proof of his innocence. The plot is just too forced, just not plausible. The film has no rhythm, no surprises, no emotion. The actors are soulless and have no chemistry, and the dialogues are banal, nearly comical. The ending is illogical. Did't appreciate it at all, I found a direction that was unable to involve me in the story that the screenplay wanted to tell."
"6","Mea Culpa","wpbhomes","1/10","25 February 2024","The fact that Netflix and others make his beyond parody awful movies like MEA CULPA and a filmmaker/actor as artless, hack, and all-around awful as Tyler Perry can be as incredibly rich and successful as he is is proof that America is the land of opportunity...money is just lying on the floor waiting to be picked up if that's what you want to do with your life. While other vastly more talented filmmakers and performers languish forever in obscurity and waiting tables, Perry lives like a feudal lord in his manor while pumping out garbage like this. MEA CULPA is like a bad parody of a paperback legal thriller you'd buy at the airport before a long flight, hoping it will bore you to sleep. Terrible shooting, the usual TP stilted melodramatic emotional tone, nonsensical plots, and wooden acting (from talented actors mind you) it's almost like he's trolling his audience (and financiers) now: look, I deliver product THIS TERRIBLE yet you continue to make me ever richer and more famous. But I give him all the credit in the world as a businessman: he's relentlessly turned his creative lemons into wealth creating lemonade, sort of like, keeping with the Atlanta spirit, Coke making billions selling sugar water. It's all in the branding and promotion, and Perry is nothing if not a brilliant self promoter. These other reviewers wondering why he doesn't use his resources to try to make something 'good' make me laugh as the miss the point so badly. His net worth is VERY good, and that's clearly the only metric he cares about. And no Mea Culpa is needed for that."
"7","Mea Culpa","nyxstrix","3/10","23 February 2024","One of the major issues with the film is the lack of chemistry between the leads. Although Rowland and Rhodes deliver good performances, the connection between their characters feels forced at times, which hampers the viewer's immersion in the story. Additionally, the plot, while well-executed, is often predictable for those familiar with the genre.However, ""Mea Culpa"" still has its merits. Perry's direction is firm and assured, maintaining the pace and tension of the story from start to finish. The soundtrack also deserves mention, contributing to the suspense and sensuality demanded by the plot. And, of course, the film's visual aesthetic, with its 1980s setting, is a delight for fans of retro style.In summary, ""Mea Culpa"" may not be the most innovative or surprising erotic thriller ever made, but it offers a fun and engaging experience for genre fans. For a night of uncomplicated entertainment, the film certainly fulfills its role."
"8","Mea Culpa","ashhaynes-88030","1/10","23 February 2024","So, let me get this right: You start the movie off introducing us to a character being accused of murder. Even going so far as to have his defense attorney describe the evidence as there being ""skull fragments in his paintings and blood that dripped down into the neighbors apartment"". He is ultimately convicted of the murder. Then, we find out the person who was ""murdered"" wasn't dead, AT ALL! When you have a character convicted of murder, and we find out the person is actually alive, you have to explain the ""blood and skull fragments in his painting"". Or else it becomes a PLOTHOLE!The acting was stiff. The direction was like watching an amateur with a decent budget.Why would you film a random motorcycle ride(which wasn't romantic, at all) for a few seconds in movie time, and not have the characters go to a destination, but to come right back to the house they just left? It was so pointless."
"9","Mea Culpa","bmsyko","3/10","23 February 2024","Well what do you know another weak script written in 2 weeks by Mr Tyler Perry. Please sir give it up already. Please hire some real writers. This peace of crap looks like it was written in 2 weeks and shot in a week. Another mediocre attempt. Don't understand why he's just happy settling for crap. This man thinks very little of his fan base. He only gives them mediocre and feels that it is good enough. My question to Mr Perry what's wrong with being great? You don't think your fans deserve better....and you wonder why your work is never rewarded. Maybe come up with.the concept and hire professional writers to execute."
"10","Mea Culpa","saysjenn","2/10","24 February 2024","I like Tyler Perry comedy films however his thrillers are seriously lacking logic. Mea Culpa is a dumpster fire of a film!Mea tried to come across as a smart, strong and professional lawyer yet she makes increasingly dumb idiotic decisions.-Mea is ""repping"" a dude on trial for murdering his girlfriend and the evidence she feels is overwhelming.-He shows what a nice guy he is by trying to make her look unprofessional by riding with him on his motorcycle in a leather skirt.-He is sexually aggressive with his lawyer. It would make anyone question his guilt but not Mea.He continues to disrespect her by getting her to follow him into a sex club that just happens to be in his apartment complex (ridiculous)He confesses his love and two seconds later he is having sex with a neighbor in front of Mea to teach her a lesson.He did all this after she wanted him to respect her boundaries! And her response was F off, find a new lawyer and you're disgusting. NOPE, all of his moves makes her throw caution to the wind and chuck her brain out the window.The sex scene with all the paint was so dumb! Sooo cheesy!!She finds the supposed dead girlfriend by mistake half way around the world but instead of catching her she flies home to her mother in law who hates her.I'm not going to bother talking about her family dynamics other than to say it was completely ridiculous and beyond unrealistic.This movie is awful. A good thriller with twists have to make sense and this one did not. If you like Lifetime movies for a laugh, you may like this one though."
