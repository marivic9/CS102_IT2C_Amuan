"1","Anyone But You","barbett-1","5/10","1 January 2024","Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"2","Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","4/10","5 January 2024","I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."

"4","Anyone But You","ambusched94","2/10","31 December 2023","After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:"
"5","Anyone But You","dogonlion","1/10","10 February 2024","There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:"
"6","Anyone But You","miza004","5/10","22 December 2023","Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:"
"7","Anyone But You","chris_rowe-881-168820","2/10","14 January 2024","This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs"

"13","Anyone But You","trinaboice","4/10","8 January 2024","A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"14","Anyone But You","ambusched94","2/10","31 December 2023","Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."
"15","Anyone But You","dogonlion","1/10","10 February 2024","This movie is exactly what I thought it would be so I can't complain too much.The two leads are both very attractive and have good chemistry, so that was entertaining to watch and nice on the eyes. It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."
"16","Anyone But You","miza004","5/10","22 December 2023","Why do we need pretty people clearly in make up (men and women) throughout, even in situations everyone would look rough in they're still perfect, it's boring, dated and lazy.Shocker, gay wedding and interracial family, I'm someone who never noticed before but this generations desperation to force things into films now is a bit embarrassing and point scoring.Fake white teeth.Lead girl can't act and has horrific voice, she failed so badly with dialogue, but I guess that's why you made sure some of her assets were visible at every moment! I'm sure her sister really wanted to see through her top!Writing was desperate and ripped off many 90s films, but failed to deliver a script of set of people that seemed real.Why are the actors so unlikeable ?Why is it ok for that guyto keep saying ""white boy things"" as an insult? When if Ben said black guy stuff this film would be cancelled.I'd put good money on SS not being cast if not for two reasons.Why can't films have a bit steamier love scenes? Why is it all so pg!"

"18","Anyone But You","cinemapersonified","4/10","22 December 2023","Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"19","Anyone But You","Remmuchan","3/10","27 December 2023","I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"20","Anyone But You","NatKaminska","1/10","28 December 2023","I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
