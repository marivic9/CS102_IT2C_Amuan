"1","Dune: Part Two","her5066","10/10","26 February 2024","This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible."
"2","Dune: Part Two","AfricanBro","9/10","26 February 2024","Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.""Power over spice is power over all""- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was ""game of thrones in space"", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind ""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi."" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timoth√©e Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the ""water of life"" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it."
"3","Dune: Part Two","and_mikkelsen","10/10","28 February 2024","This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!Now I am gonna watch this movie again, and maybe again! Then I am gonna read the books!"
"4","Dune: Part Two","Ellimof","10/10","26 February 2024","If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol."
"5","Dune: Part Two","HalBanksy","10/10","4 March 2024","A monumental piece of cinema. And combined with Part 1, we have one of the greatest adaptations in genre literature history.It's clear everyone on set was aware that they were working on something special here - because literally every single person in this production have brought their A-Game for a truly incredible technical achievement. And easily the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring.Paced to perfection, at once uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking and beyond THRILLING. Dave Bautista fights someone to the death, while hanging onto the outside of a helicopter that is being shot out of the sky - and that doesn't even reach the Top 10 action set-pieces in the film.. It just doesn't get better than this."
"6","Dune: Part Two","Dvir971","10/10","26 February 2024","Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended."
"7","Dune: Part Two","poseyfan","10/10","1 March 2024","""Dune"" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve."
"8","Dune: Part Two","awessel-58117","10/10","26 February 2024","This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every seen. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10."
"9","Dune: Part Two","HabibieHakim123","10/10","28 February 2024","In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timoth√©e Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver."
"10","Dune: Part Two","Sleepin_Dragon","10/10","29 February 2024","Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.10/10."
