"1","Lurrose 6Pcs Unisex Wavy Headband Metal Hair Hoop Ordinary Headwear Hair Accessories for Women and Men","mae","Reviewed in Australia on 26 December 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars","        The pieces were too tight at the tips. Looked great on but just too tightly fitted. Maybe I got a childâ€™s one?  "
"2","Lurrose 6Pcs Unisex Wavy Headband Metal Hair Hoop Ordinary Headwear Hair Accessories for Women and Men","Derdep","Reviewed in Australia on 8 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The quality of these are good considering the price. My only complaint is that they hurt the area behind your ears after wearing them or a long period of time. However most headbands are like this and the quality it still good for how much u get.  "
"3","Lurrose 6Pcs Unisex Wavy Headband Metal Hair Hoop Ordinary Headwear Hair Accessories for Women and Men","Diana Ridley","Reviewed in Australia on 15 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I only use two of them that came in the packet because the rest are not as comfortable. It is also uncomfortable when you lay down on your side. The black paint peeled off my most used one in a lot of area but ultimately I use it everyday and it is very handy at keeping my hair out of my face.  "

"6","Lurrose 6Pcs Unisex Wavy Headband Metal Hair Hoop Ordinary Headwear Hair Accessories for Women and Men","Eddy Dasilva","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        Light weight headbands, with various varieties that rest on my hair well.  The backings do not dig in as much as metal ones.  I can wear it comfortably for working day and great for exercising as they don't slip off.  "

"14","Lurrose 6Pcs Unisex Wavy Headband Metal Hair Hoop Ordinary Headwear Hair Accessories for Women and Men","Derdep","Reviewed in Australia on 8 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Good group of hair of accessories to test what works for oneâ€™s hair type and preferred styles.  For my preferred hairstyles,  I found that two of the metal hair bands are excellent, two are OK, and the final two are designed for thicker hair than mine (good for gifts).  The headbands were a little stiff at first but softened after a couple gym outings and washes.  Now are very comfortable and functional.  Overall, well worth the price I paid.  "

"18","Lurrose 6Pcs Unisex Wavy Headband Metal Hair Hoop Ordinary Headwear Hair Accessories for Women and Men","Bec","Reviewed in Australia on 16 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Good set with a variety of waves for different holds on hair. I just leave them around in the bathroom and house for where I would mostly use these. Note that some pinch the side of the head behind the ear a bit so you can bend it a bit or push it back to not cause stress in those areas. The come with a rubber cover each side to reduce the sharp edges in these spots  "

All of them are very comfortable to wear & the tension of the wire didnâ€™t hurt my head like other headbands did. I can take it off easily without having some of my hair stuck in the headband.  "
