In generale il risultato corrisponde a quanto descritto.    "

Preferisco la profumazione del gel della stessa linea, per fortuna durante l'asciugatura la profumazione di questo leave in si affievolisce. Ma il fatto che faccia questo odore forte è sicuramente dovuto anche al fatto che gli ingredienti sono naturali. Per i ricci, come consistenza e capacità di attivazione del riccio è fantastico. Insieme al gel la piega mi dura 3 giorni pieni. Eccetto la profumazione ho apprezzato complessivamente il prodotto. Lo consiglio    "
