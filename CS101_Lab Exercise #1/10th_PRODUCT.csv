"6","Logitech MX Master 3S - Wireless Performance Mouse with Ultra-Fast Scrolling, Ergo, 8K DPI, Track on Glass, Quiet Clicks, USB-C, Bluetooth, Windows, Linux, Chrome","James Peek","Reviewed in Australia on 11 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I bought these when I started a new job a few months ago. I work extensively with spreadsheets and engineering drawings.The MX Master 3S is my first ergonomic mouse and it has been a pleasure to use. It is comfortable, quiet, and feels absolutely premium.The only drawback I have come across is that the side scrollwheel can become unpredictable when you have many tabs open and not function as it is required to. My fix has been to launch the Logi software or switch the mouse on and off again. This will likely be patched out with a firmware update.This mouse is quite pricey, but it does what all high quality products do: make you forget about the money you spent once you start using it.  "

Cannot complain about the mouse but i'd buy it somewhere where I don't have to stay home all day waiting in the future  "
"10","Logitech MX Master 3S - Wireless Performance Mouse with Ultra-Fast Scrolling, Ergo, 8K DPI, Track on Glass, Quiet Clicks, USB-C, Bluetooth, Windows, Linux, Chrome","Jai Schulz","Reviewed in Australia on 28 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        The most I've ever spent on a mouse prior to this was about $50 so I was very hesitant about dropping over $100 for this but I'm glad I did. Originally wanted to get the Apple Magic Mouse for the built in touch pad however never liked the ergonomics of it even though I have relatively small hands.Initially I felt that the MX Master might be a bit too big for my hands and I was close to returning it however after about 2 days I became used to it and now it feels very comfortable to use.The side scroll and thumb gesture button almost mimics the functionality of the Magic Mouse, allowing you to perform actions such as opening Mission Control, switch desktops etc.The scrolling is very smooth and you can easily switch between frictionless and ratchet scrolling. The frictionless scrolling is amazing and you can easily get through large documents with a simple flick, however I find that it is a bit sensitive so generally leave it in the normal mode which is still very good but feels more tactile.Only real negative I have for it is the rubberised area where your palm rests. It gets a bit dirty and can get easily scratched by an inadvertent fingernail as you switch between using the mouse and keyboard. Luckily it's easy to rub out however I think deeper scratches might leave a more permanent mark.Highly recommended especially if you use a Mac and want to retain the functionality of the trackpad but you don't like the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse.

"15","Logitech MX Master 3S - Wireless Performance Mouse with Ultra-Fast Scrolling, Ergo, 8K DPI, Track on Glass, Quiet Clicks, USB-C, Bluetooth, Windows, Linux, Chrome","Dylan James","Reviewed in Australia on 29 March 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        The Logitech MX Master 3S stands out with its ultra-fast scrolling, ergonomic design, and the ability to track on almost any surface, including glass. Its quiet clicks and versatile connectivity options, ranging from USB-C to Bluetooth, make it a top choice for both Windows and Linux users. However, I found the battery life to be a tad shorter than anticipated. Overall, a great product but with slight room for improvement in the battery department.  "

But two things bug me about it:1. On a MacBook Pro with ProMotion screen, I cannot get it to scroll the image/website smoothly, despite adjusting all settings. Using the trackpad, the image moves smoothly. 🤷‍♀️2. Don’t get a white mouse. After a while, it WILL discolour despite best efforts to keep it white.  "

And guess what the place the selection button underneath the mouse so it becomes this pause, flip the mouse over and press a button three times :(Why such I big fuss . . . . I also own a Logitech PRECISION PRO Wireless Mouse, they have the same function, but the button on the SIDE, ease select with your thumb and off you go.Other than that great mouse and I suggest to turn on the power of the mouse / KB when you don't use it and you can use them for weeks without charging :)  "
