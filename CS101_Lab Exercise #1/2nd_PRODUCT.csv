","Reviewed in Australia on 29 January 2024","4.7 out of 5 stars","        This is a great shampoo and conditioner combination for keeping your Hair and scalp in greatest  condition,It is not harsh on your scalp or skin around your head face, ears and eyes, it is easy to rinse out after washing and is also great for washing not just your Scalp but also around your hairline behind your ears right down to your upper shoulders, not so much your face but it does not hurt at all. a Great all-rounder depending on skin type and this particular bottle is great for most hair and scalp types, so if you are  stuck and have a family that all have close skin and scalp types this will work for everyone if you are on holidays or just want an all-round shampoo and scalp wash that suites the whole family,  alsoTry Head & Shoulders Smooth & Silky Conditioner. It deeply moisturizes hair and scalp and leaves your hair touchably soft. It's also a perfect antidote for itching, redness and dry scalp.  "

"10","Head & Shoulders Clean Balanced Anti Dandruff Shampoo 660ml (Pack of 1)","Vincent","Reviewed in Australia on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Bought for my Tween daughter (with dead straight hair) who was suffering from an itchy and dry scalp... Worked perfectly and resolved her scalp issues within 2 weeks of use. After a few months, she has stopped using it for now, as it is a heavier weight Shampoo. Now I use it, as my hair is curly and dry and it's been awesome. I hate shampoo that strips my hair, this is great for holding the moisture.  "
