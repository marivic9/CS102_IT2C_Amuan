It doesn't irritate or dry your scalp. I feel like I want to use it everyday although I'm only suppose to use to 3 times a week. I really like it and recommend it. Great shampoo!  "

"7","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","Anthony Rutherford","Reviewed in Australia on 18 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I heard this product from dermdoctor on YouTube. I had oily scalp, flaky dandruff, and the worst one, it hurts my scalp when I move my hair! I tried a few different anti dandruff shampoo, and they didn’t do much. But this! Nizoral worked on FIRST TRY!!! Seriously I can’t recommend this shampoo enough! My scalp immediately stopped hurting, very little flakes remained, not oily at all after 3-4 days. I wash my hair every Monday and Thursday, they always get oily and has this white oily buildup when I scratch my hair. Now I’m at my 3rd wash with Nizoral, my scalp doesn’t hurt at all, I haven’t seen any flakes for a few days, and it didn’t feel oily at all on this Monday so that I forgot to wash my hair lol. I’m so happy with this shampoo, and I’m so grateful to Dr. Shah and Dr. Maxfield.  "

Prior to using Nizoral he used to use head and shoulders. He used Nizoral for a week and the dry scalp, itchiness, and dandruff went away. This stuff is amazing, highly recommend.  "

"15","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","Syed Usman Hussain","Reviewed in Australia on 4 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        This shampoo is what I need for my scalp. I have been dealing with dry scalp for several months until I couldn't handle it anymore. My skin was itchy. I purchased this shampoo because of the reviews and they are true! The shampoo works! I am just buying a second one because mine is gone. I didn't use it for 6 months and now due to the dry Colorado weather, I am starting to experience some symptoms of dry scalp again. Anyways, its works!  "
"16","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","Daniel J D'Souza","Reviewed in Australia on 25 October 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I had a weird thing happen.  When I was in Aruba I was climbing onto a catamaran to go on a sunset cruise.  I slammed the top of my head on this overhang that literally said, “what your head.”  I saw stars.  I do believe I got a concussion.  Anyway - fast forward a month later and the area on my head was getting so itchy.  I kept trying different shampoos, serums, treatments, etc and nothing really helped.  All of a sudden last week that area on my head was itchier than ever and I almost died when I saw all of the flakes in my hair. I have black hair and it literally looked like I had been out in the snow.  I was horrified!!  I have never had this kind of issue of itchy, flaky scalp, ever!!  I tried Hair Envy, a hair serum that is supposed to help dry, flaky scalps.  I used a few other oils with no success.  I even put Aloe gel I got in Aruba on my scalp trying to soothe it.  All I wanted to do was scratch my head so hard, it was driving me crazy!!  I came on Amazon to look for a shampoo for dry scalp and this was the first one that came up. It had SO many good reviews.  I read tons of them. I thought, ok let me give it a try.  I got the hair conditioner as well.  I used it for the first time today.  NO FLAKES!!  After one use!!  Once in a while I may get a slight twinge of an itch but it doesn’t even bother me.  I didn’t believe this was going to do anything for me since I had already tried so many other products.  After one wash I am so pleased.  I’ve been told the reason for this scalp irritation could be due to me slamming my head on that boat and there could actually be either nerve damage on my head or swelling under the skin that is effecting a lack of blood flow to the top of my scalp. So typical of my luck.  But this shampoo has helped with the discomfort in just one wash.  My hair feels so clean and soft.  I thought for sure the smell of the shampoo would have a strong unpleasant scent. It barely has a scent all and the little scent it has is quite pleasant.  I highly recommend this!!!  I cannot wait to use it a few more times to see if those little twinges of itch I am still feeling completely go away.  "
"17","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","Maria Natalia","Reviewed in the United States on 5 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        Bought this after being referred to it by my mom. I've had an ongoing battle with dandruff for years now and have tried practically EVERYTHING! From Head&Shoulders to T-Gel and nothing has helped. This is a last ditch effort before going to a dermatologist for help. I've been using this for about 3 weeks and I use it about 4 times a week, I even let it sit on my scalp for about 2-3min before rinsing. So far my scalp has been less itchy and looks more hydrated, but I'm still dealing with dandruff just not as bad as it was. This product doesn't dry my hair like alot of other ones do, and for reference I have fine hair. The scent also isn't overpowering or off putting for me like T-gel or Selsun Blue is. Overall the product is helping just not completely eliminating my dandruff like I'd hoped. I will finish the bottle though and possibly purchase another in the future.  "
"18","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","Jennifer Cerulli","Reviewed in the United States on 17 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I’m not seeing visible dandruff flakes anymore after a week of usage which is a plus! That said, my scalp is still itchy every so often so I’m not 100% sure if this is fully working, but I’ll take the win of not being embarrassed by visible dandruff any day. The smell is pretty pleasant and it lathers well. I rinse 2x daily with it and am hoping the itching goes away altogether soon!  "
"19","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","chenoa schott","Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I got this when I started seeing dandruff. After about 4 uses, I started seeing the results. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dandruff issues. The scent is not the best, but is not bad either. Might not be very moisturizing. But again, very effective against dandruff.  "
"20","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","CLA","Reviewed in the United States on 3 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I gave this 4 stars for it does not work for the follicular dermatitis and itchy scalp as was claimed in writing....at least not on my scalp.  It probably is great for dandruff/flakiness, which it claims on the bottle, but dandruff/flakiness is not my problem.  So, I bought the Nizoral for Psoriasis instead which soothes my itchy scalp...and I don't have psoriasis either.  No one seems to know what I have for nothing shows up.  I personally think it is a drug reaction...a cancer drug.  No matter, the Nizoral for Psoriasis does the trick.  "
"21","Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, Fresh Scent, 7 Fl Oz","Guruprasad Panda","Reviewed in the United States on 4 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I think this was a bit too watery however it worked for me I used it like twice per week It also makes your hair very dry after washing too so  oil your scalp after washing. I think its best that u start using this when u notice you have flakes it works well.  "

No clue as to how effective it'll be. Will update once i've used for 2 weeks -ish, IF it works to reduce my body acne (as it did when used for such 10 years ago).  "
