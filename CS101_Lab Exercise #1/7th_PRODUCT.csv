I don't think it is the best product for my hair type - I have very dry 2c hair that is prone to frizz, and will sometimes go into actual curls. This product is too heavy for me, but it works well as a leave in treatment or mask every now and then. It would probably work better for people with hair that is thicker, more porous, and curlier than mine.  "

It works well, like any good conditioner should but the fragrance is a little too strong. In trying to sell itself as a natural product, parfum should not be one of its ingredients. Maybe mildly scented with essential oils would be a better option. I like it in a tub as I don't waste any, unlike those that come in a dispenser.  "
"5","Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask, Smoothing & Hydrating, Hair Food Macadamia, 390ml","Dan G","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","        It's got a nice subtle smell, it's quite a thick mixture, you don't need much. I do find if I don't rince it all out properly then it can leave my hair quite greasy, so I tend to avoid using it as a leave in conditioner. Doesn't really help with frizzyness.  "

"13","Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask, Smoothing & Hydrating, Hair Food Macadamia, 390ml","Robert","Reviewed in Australia on 11 October 2022","4.6 out of 5 stars","        Garnier Fructis Watermelon Scented Shampoo Soap and Cream 3-in-1 Conditioner - True honest October 2022 review by an Aussie guy too embarrassed to tell his mates about it. The smell of this soap is divine. It's also true what it says on the box, one soap bar will last as long as 2 bottles of shampoo. In my opinion it will last longer because once you wet your hair in the shower, you only have to move the soap over your hair a couple of times and it lathers up very thick and frothy. It might last me at least a year or more! Very little goes a long way. It cleans my hair really well and I finish it off with the matching tub of 3-in-1 Watermelon scented creme Conditioner, which also smells great. Just the same as the soap, you only need a small amount of the conditioning cream and it works into your hair well and afterleaving it in for a minuteI can tell my hair feels fine and silky smooth whilst washing it out.  I reckon it will last me over a year too! My fine hair dries soft and light, not oily, and I can smell my own hair all day. I thoroughly recommend both products as a set.  "
