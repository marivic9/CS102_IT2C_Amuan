"6","Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner, 384 ml","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The moisture after one use of the product is worth purchasing. I have long and very thick hair so this product actually really helped with the smoothness and richness of my hair. I do have to say my hair did get oily after two days so this may be the cause as it does have great oils in it. So if you are looking for something with natural products but may result in washing your hair alot more during the week then this is for you :)  "

"16","Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner, 384 ml","Alex Pedretti","Reviewed in Italy on 13 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","      Ich bin wirklich zufrieden mit dem Produkt. Ich habe einen Mix aus Wellen und Locken und meine Haare sind eher fein und leicht. Am meisten gef√§llt mir der Duft, den man selbst noch nach 3 Tagen riecht, lecker nach Kokosnuss. Es pflegt auch definitiv die Haare und macht sie in meinem Fall geschmeidiger und weicher. Also weniger definiert.. aber das gef√§llt mir. Sie sind danach sch√∂n griffig und gef√ºhlt auch irgendwie dicker. Dennoch ziehe ich einen Punkt ab, weil das hier nun mal auch kein Wundermittel ist, wie man es sich vielleicht erhofft. Man hat danach nat√ºrlich nicht die super gl√§nzenden Haare wie aus einer Werbung. Ich werde es dennoch nachbestellen, weil es nat√ºrliche Inhaltsstoffe hat und f√ºr mich vollkommen ausreicht. Wenn ich am Ende noch etwas Jojoba√∂l in die Haare gebe, bin ich zufrieden. Die perfekten Haare bekomme ich vermutlich doch nur mit Hilfe von Hitze :P    "

So i gave it a try. Smells like heaven not too heavy . But i am not sure is fragrance good for conditioner. works moderately good. Packaging is good ( it leaked a little when i received it like a drop). so i would not recommend it.  "

But SO FAR - so good! I love the smell, it‚Äôs so rich feeling, and made my hair overall soft and fresh after I was done in the shower. I have type 3a/3b and it definitely defined them for only the first use! I strongly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a soothing and great smelling condition üôèüèº  "

"20","Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner, 384 ml","Abigail","Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm on my 2nd bottle of this conditioner. The bottle/pump are a bit annoying, as it pumps out the conditioner really slowly. I'm a dude with less-than-shoulder-length hair, and I have to pump it 30+ times just to get the right amount of conditioner.My first bottle, the pump got stuck when I was about 2/3 done the conditioner, and it's too thick to pour, so I had to cut the bottle open to not waste any. The 2nd bottle I just got today, the pump was stuck from the , so again I had to cut it open.I greatly recommend using this conditioner if you want luscious curls, but be prepared to struggle with actually accessing the conditioner inside the bottle.

"21","Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner, 384 ml","MP","Reviewed in France on 7 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","      El pedido no lleg√≥ a mi domicilio, tuve que buscarlo en correos. Ven√≠a bien envuelto, un pl√°stico cubr√≠a la botella. Ya lo he usado 2 veces al acondicionador y el perfume que tiene es r√≠quisimo. La textura se desliza muy f√°cil por la mano y tengo que tener cuidado de no tirar el producto o que se adhiera bien al pelo. Espero que la botella me dure 2 meses o 3 con el precio que tiene. Estoy haciendo el m√©todo curly y es muy pronto para ver un cambio. Por ejemplo cuando me lavo s√≥lo con acondicionador me siento el pelo suave pero cuando utilizo shampoo + acondicionador se me ve muy seco, una escoba parece. Aunque he leido que al principio pasa eso. Creo que es muy pronto para dar una buena opini√≥n.    "
