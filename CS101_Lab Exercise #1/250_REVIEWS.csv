When I was in Aruba I was climbing onto a catamaran to go on a sunset cruise.  I slammed the top of my head on this overhang that literally said, ‚Äúwhat your head.‚Äù  I saw stars.  I do believe I got a concussion.  Anyway - fast forward a month later and the area on my head was getting so itchy.  I kept trying different shampoos, serums, treatments, etc and nothing really helped.  All of a sudden last week that area on my head was itchier than ever and I almost died when I saw all of the flakes in my hair. I have black hair and it literally looked like I had been out in the snow.  I was horrified!!  I have never had this kind of issue of itchy, flaky scalp, ever!!  I tried Hair Envy, a hair serum that is supposed to help dry, flaky scalps.  I used a few other oils with no success.  I even put Aloe gel I got in Aruba on my scalp trying to soothe it.  All I wanted to do was scratch my head so hard, it was driving me crazy!!  I came on Amazon to look for a shampoo for dry scalp and this was the first one that came up. It had SO many good reviews.  I read tons of them. I thought, ok let me give it a try.  I got the hair conditioner as well.  I used it for the first time today.  NO FLAKES!!  After one use!!  Once in a while I may get a slight twinge of an itch but it doesn‚Äôt even bother me.  I didn‚Äôt believe this was going to do anything for me since I had already tried so many other products.  After one wash I am so pleased.  I‚Äôve been told the reason for this scalp irritation could be due to me slamming my head on that boat and there could actually be either nerve damage on my head or swelling under the skin that is effecting a lack of blood flow to the top of my scalp. So typical of my luck.  But this shampoo has helped with the discomfort in just one wash.  My hair feels so clean and soft.  I thought for sure the smell of the shampoo would have a strong unpleasant scent. It barely has a scent all and the little scent it has is quite pleasant.  I highly recommend this!!!  I cannot wait to use it a few more times to see if those little twinges of itch I am still feeling completely go away.  "

I've had an ongoing battle with dandruff for years now and have tried practically EVERYTHING! From Head&Shoulders to T-Gel and nothing has helped. This is a last ditch effort before going to a dermatologist for help. I've been using this for about 3 weeks and I use it about 4 times a week, I even let it sit on my scalp for about 2-3min before rinsing. So far my scalp has been less itchy and looks more hydrated, but I'm still dealing with dandruff just not as bad as it was. This product doesn't dry my hair like alot of other ones do, and for reference I have fine hair. The scent also isn't overpowering or off putting for me like T-gel or Selsun Blue is. Overall the product is helping just not completely eliminating my dandruff like I'd hoped. I will finish the bottle though and possibly purchase another in the future.  "

So, I bought the Nizoral for Psoriasis instead which soothes my itchy scalp...and I don't have psoriasis either.  No one seems to know what I have for nothing shows up.

Es pflegt auch definitiv die Haare und macht sie in meinem Fall geschmeidiger und weicher. Also weniger definiert.. aber das gef√§llt mir. Sie sind danach sch√∂n griffig und gef√ºhlt auch irgendwie dicker. Dennoch ziehe ich einen Punkt ab, weil das hier nun mal auch kein Wundermittel ist, wie man es sich vielleicht erhofft. Man hat danach nat√ºrlich nicht die super gl√§nzenden Haare wie aus einer Werbung. Ich werde es dennoch nachbestellen, weil es nat√ºrliche Inhaltsstoffe hat und f√ºr mich vollkommen ausreicht. Wenn ich am Ende noch etwas Jojoba√∂l in die Haare gebe, bin ich zufrieden. Die perfekten Haare bekomme ich vermutlich doch nur mit Hilfe von Hitze :P    "

"146","Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner, 384 ml","MP","Reviewed in France on 7 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","      El pedido no lleg√≥ a mi domicilio, tuve que buscarlo en correos. Ven√≠a bien envuelto, un pl√°stico cubr√≠a la botella. Ya lo he usado 2 veces al acondicionador y el perfume que tiene es r√≠quisimo. La textura se desliza muy f√°cil por la mano y tengo que tener cuidado de no tirar el producto o que se adhiera bien al pelo. Espero que la botella me dure 2 meses o 3 con el precio que tiene. Estoy haciendo el m√©todo curly y es muy pronto para ver un cambio. Por ejemplo cuando me lavo s√≥lo con acondicionador me siento el pelo suave pero cuando utilizo shampoo + acondicionador se me ve muy seco, una escoba parece. Aunque he leido que al principio pasa eso. Creo que es muy pronto para dar una buena opini√≥n.    "

It works well, like any good conditioner should but the fragrance is a little too strong. In trying to sell itself as a natural product, parfum should not be one of its ingredients. Maybe mildly scented with essential oils would be a better option. I like it in a tub as I don't waste any, unlike those that come in a dispenser.  "

The smell of this soap is divine. It's also true what it says on the box, one soap bar will last as long as 2 bottles of shampoo. In my opinion it will last longer because once you wet your hair in the shower, you only have to move the soap over your hair a couple of times and it lathers up very thick and frothy. It might last me at least a year or more! Very little goes a long way. It cleans my hair really well and I finish it off with the matching tub of 3-in-1 Watermelon scented creme Conditioner, which also smells great. Just the same as the soap, you only need a small amount of the conditioning cream and it works into your hair well and afterleaving it in for a minuteI can tell my hair feels fine and silky smooth whilst washing it out.  I reckon it will last me over a year too! My fine hair dries soft and light, not oily, and I can smell my own hair all day. I thoroughly recommend both products as a set.  "

The screen stops working correctly when the device is being charged. I tested different chargers and cables and the issue is definitely with this particular wire. Maybe they have fixed that issue in the more recently manufactured batches but buyer beware. The sturdiness of the cable is its saving grace.  "

Originally wanted to get the Apple Magic Mouse for the built in touch pad however never liked the ergonomics of it even though I have relatively small hands.Initially I felt that the MX Master might be a bit too big for my hands and I was close to returning it however after about 2 days I became used to it and now it feels very comfortable to use.The side scroll and thumb gesture button almost mimics the functionality of the Magic Mouse, allowing you to perform actions such as opening Mission Control, switch desktops etc.The scrolling is very smooth and you can easily switch between frictionless and ratchet scrolling. The frictionless scrolling is amazing and you can easily get through large documents with a simple flick, however I find that it is a bit sensitive so generally leave it in the normal mode which is still very good but feels more tactile.Only real negative I have for it is the rubberised area where your palm rests. It gets a bit dirty and can get easily scratched by an inadvertent fingernail as you switch between using the mouse and keyboard. Luckily it's easy to rub out however I think deeper scratches might leave a more permanent mark.Highly recommended especially if you use a Mac and want to retain the functionality of the trackpad but you don't like the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse.

I also own a Logitech PRECISION PRO Wireless Mouse, they have the same function, but the button on the SIDE, ease select with your thumb and off you go.Other than that great mouse and I suggest to turn on the power of the mouse / KB when you don't use it and you can use them for weeks without charging :)  "
