"10","ThermoPro TP49W Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer",NA,"Reinder",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazing little device, had for couple of months now and still going strong and the original batteries. I got it as a happy medium between the baby monitor camera temperature sensor and the Sensibo sensor for controlling our AC. The camera is mounted high on the wall and was never be accurate because heat rises and the Sensibo sensor has to be near the AC so kt tells you it's freezing cold when in fact it's eight under the airflow. I have this gadget near our bub's red light and it has final say on temperature for dressing bub for nighttime.Also good to note, it does NOT have button batteries, just one AAA."
