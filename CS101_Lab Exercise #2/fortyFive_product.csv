"1","AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Pool Cleaner Robot",NA,"M. S. Raven","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2022","3.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","*UPDATED*The seller reached out to me and wanted to help find a product that better suited my pool needs, with no additional cost. They sent me a  Seagull Elite and let me tell you… this thing is nice. The other Aiper vacuums were packed nice but the elite surpasses the others. This bad boy climbs my incline, stands almost straight up to get the sides of the pool and….. I had a plastic diving fish at the bottom of the pool and the vacuum sucked it up like it was a piece of dirt. The suction is amazing and their customer service is beyond exceptional. Viper sets the tone of what customer service should be.I’m glad I didn’t switch brands. I hope “GI Jane” is here with us for many summers to come.I originally purchased the 2021 version last year. I absolutely loved it! It was able to clean my shallow end 2” that slowly slipped down to  my deep end of 5”. The suction, ability to get the sides of the pool wall were on point. I told everyone that my little pool vacuum was a superhero. It fought pool dirt while I floated… well worth it. That was until it died 5 months later, RIP Helen.I assumed I just bought a faulty product and never hesitated to purchase the 2023 model. I read the the great reviews and was super excited to have another superhero be able to do the dirty work for me.  I have run the new vacuum 3xs and there is still debris at the bottom of the pool. In all fairness, the pool hasn’t been vacuumed most of the winter, but it is also screened in! The new 2023 model doesn’t get the corners, can’t go up my small incline and the deeper end still have debris. As you can see in the pictures, it’s not a huge pool. I really wanted to love this, but I don’t.Pro:-Love the new look and the power button on the top of the 2023.-It was nicely packaged-Was excited to see it came with extra parts.The price was $299 and I was able to purchase it for $200, not a bad price.-customer service is exceptionalCons:-Only cleans the deeper end.-Can not go up the 2-3” incline.-Doesn’t go up the sides or get the corners.- Even though the look has improved, the quality has decreased.Unfortunately, I’m going to return it. $200 for a vacuum that only cleans 45% of the pool isn’t practical.I would love to see if the next model up is better quality but it’s not in my price point at the moment.I guess I’m going to have to fight pool dirt and crime alone."

"5","AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Pool Cleaner Robot",NA,"Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","2/4 I’m am changing my rating due to the customer service I have continually received. I done the review below and the company reached out to me. They sent me a brand new unit and gave me a warranty. However by the time I received it, pool season was over. They reached out to me again this past week to FOLLOW UP and make sure I was happy and the 2nd unit was working. After explaining the closing of season they extend the warranty as to allow me time to use the unit. THAT IS AWESOME SERVICE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING FROM THEM. I HAVE NEVER HAD SERVICE LIKE THIS. I WOULD GIVE THEM 10 stars if I could!!!!So confused. I have troubleshooted and can not find any info out on this product. I loved it for the 4 times I used it. On the 4th time I thought it did not run that long, before the battery died. I hooked it up to charge and it just continually beeped and the lights went through flashing various colors (bluish white, green, red). Finally after 3 days tried again and it started charging. I put back in the pool and it started working maybe 10 minutes before it stopped. So I brought it back out checked it and restarted it. It then would kick in move a foot and stop. This went on several times. I took it out and let it drain and was going to see if needed charging. I plugged it up and lights and beeping continually. Now it will not work. SO DISAPPOINTED because I was truly excited about this product saving me time and helping with my arm and back where I had surgery. Wish the company would replace the product. But dont know if they would. I bought it back in December 2021. Dont know what to do."
"6","AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Pool Cleaner Robot",NA,"mike plezia","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This product worked as advertised about 20 times and then just broke down. I let in power all the way down and recharged it. Cleaned it repeatedly and tried everything to get it to keep working. Today it goes in the trash. You might have better luck, but I expect something to last at least a year or more. This was a couple of months.After I wrote that review, the manufacturer contacted me offering a replacement. I hadn't asked for one nor did I think I could get one, guessing it had a 90 day warranty like most things and you're lucky if someone cares even then. This company cared and responded quickly to my complaint and sent a replacement which is operating in my pool as i write this. No extra charge and they didn't need the other one returned. I changed my review to five stars because no matter how long this one last, this company cared about its customers and that was VERY impressive to me.  I thank them openly here for both a quick response and keeping their promise to me."

"8","AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Pool Cleaner Robot",NA,"Lori Burnett","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This single purchase has taken pool maintenance from almost unmanageable to easy-breezy. We have an above ground Bestway pool (12x20) and the month of July is typically a battle against algae. We purchased this in June and I’m glad we did! Typically we would have to completely vacuum the pool 3x/week minimum to keep the algae at bay, on top of regular chemicals, brushing the sides, etc. This robot is doing the job of that vacuuming. It is simple to use, holds a charge for 90 minutes, and comes with a hook for fishing it out of the pool. Once charged, you simply submerge it in the water, hold the power button down until the lights turn on, and once you see the water flowing through, you let go. It will run a grid across the pool for 90 minutes (more than enough time to clean our entire pool), and it will seek the edge when battery is low. When you’re done you simply rinse the filter and interior, allow it to dry, and throw it back on the charger. We have been using it daily, as long as chemical level isn’t too high. You want to check your chemicals before running this in your pool- if they’re in the “ideal” range, toss it in. If they’re above, don’t run it, as the high chemical content can erode the components. We now have a much more manageable routine of brushing sides before running the robot, and our pool is crystal clear this year. Hands down I would purchase this again, and highly recommend it. One note- this product is specifically recommended for above ground pools- if you have a built in pool,  you want the model higher than this one that can climb the walls. Honestly genius product, well made, and does the work of traditional vacuuming."
"9","AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Pool Cleaner Robot",NA,"Kindle Customer","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","The amount of sand and gunk this thing picks up is unreal. I find that all four corners in my rectangular pool needs a little extra attention after this device is finished sweeping/vacuuming. Battery lasts about 90 minutes. My pool is 12 foot x 24 foot, and it cleans the whole bottom in that time. I like that it comes with the retrieval hook. Easy to clean when it’s done. All in all this bad boy saves me about 3-5 hours a week. I’m not sure how it does with leaves and large debris, I live in the desert, just have a lot of dust and sand getting in our pool."

After explaining the closing of season they extend the warranty as to allow me time to use the unit. THAT IS AWESOME SERVICE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING FROM THEM. I HAVE NEVER HAD SERVICE LIKE THIS. I WOULD GIVE THEM 10 stars if I could!!!!So confused. I have troubleshooted and can not find any info out on this product. I loved it for the 4 times I used it. On the 4th time I thought it did not run that long, before the battery died. I hooked it up to charge and it just continually beeped and the lights went through flashing various colors (bluish white, green, red). Finally after 3 days tried again and it started charging. I put back in the pool and it started working maybe 10 minutes before it stopped. So I brought it back out checked it and restarted it. It then would kick in move a foot and stop. This went on several times. I took it out and let it drain and was going to see if needed charging. I plugged it up and lights and beeping continually. Now it will not work. SO DISAPPOINTED because I was truly excited about this product saving me time and helping with my arm and back where I had surgery. Wish the company would replace the product. But dont know if they would. I bought it back in December 2021. Dont know what to do."

I let in power all the way down and recharged it. Cleaned it repeatedly and tried everything to get it to keep working. Today it goes in the trash. You might have better luck, but I expect something to last at least a year or more. This was a couple of months.After I wrote that review, the manufacturer contacted me offering a replacement. I hadn't asked for one nor did I think I could get one, guessing it had a 90 day warranty like most things and you're lucky if someone cares even then. This company cared and responded quickly to my complaint and sent a replacement which is operating in my pool as i write this. No extra charge and they didn't need the other one returned. I changed my review to five stars because no matter how long this one last, this company cared about its customers and that was VERY impressive to me.  I thank them openly here for both a quick response and keeping their promise to me."

"38","AIPER Seagull SE Cordless Pool Cleaner Robot",NA,"Lori Burnett","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This single purchase has taken pool maintenance from almost unmanageable to easy-breezy. We have an above ground Bestway pool (12x20) and the month of July is typically a battle against algae. We purchased this in June and I’m glad we did! Typically we would have to completely vacuum the pool 3x/week minimum to keep the algae at bay, on top of regular chemicals, brushing the sides, etc. This robot is doing the job of that vacuuming. It is simple to use, holds a charge for 90 minutes, and comes with a hook for fishing it out of the pool. Once charged, you simply submerge it in the water, hold the power button down until the lights turn on, and once you see the water flowing through, you let go. It will run a grid across the pool for 90 minutes (more than enough time to clean our entire pool), and it will seek the edge when battery is low. When you’re done you simply rinse the filter and interior, allow it to dry, and throw it back on the charger. We have been using it daily, as long as chemical level isn’t too high. You want to check your chemicals before running this in your pool- if they’re in the “ideal” range, toss it in. If they’re above, don’t run it, as the high chemical content can erode the components. We now have a much more manageable routine of brushing sides before running the robot, and our pool is crystal clear this year. Hands down I would purchase this again, and highly recommend it. One note- this product is specifically recommended for above ground pools- if you have a built in pool,  you want the model higher than this one that can climb the walls. Honestly genius product, well made, and does the work of traditional vacuuming."

I find that all four corners in my rectangular pool needs a little extra attention after this device is finished sweeping/vacuuming. Battery lasts about 90 minutes. My pool is 12 foot x 24 foot, and it cleans the whole bottom in that time. I like that it comes with the retrieval hook. Easy to clean when it’s done. All in all this bad boy saves me about 3-5 hours a week. I’m not sure how it does with leaves and large debris, I live in the desert, just have a lot of dust and sand getting in our pool."

Raven","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2022","3.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","*UPDATED*The seller reached out to me and wanted to help find a product that better suited my pool needs, with no additional cost. They sent me a  Seagull Elite and let me tell you… this thing is nice. The other Aiper vacuums were packed nice but the elite surpasses the others. This bad boy climbs my incline, stands almost straight up to get the sides of the pool and….. I had a plastic diving fish at the bottom of the pool and the vacuum sucked it up like it was a piece of dirt. The suction is amazing and their customer service is beyond exceptional. Viper sets the tone of what customer service should be.I’m glad I didn’t switch brands. I hope “GI Jane” is here with us for many summers to come.I originally purchased the 2021 version last year. I absolutely loved it! It was able to clean my shallow end 2” that slowly slipped down to  my deep end of 5”. The suction, ability to get the sides of the pool wall were on point. I told everyone that my little pool vacuum was a superhero. It fought pool dirt while I floated… well worth it. That was until it died 5 months later, RIP Helen.I assumed I just bought a faulty product and never hesitated to purchase the 2023 model. I read the the great reviews and was super excited to have another superhero be able to do the dirty work for me.  I have run the new vacuum 3xs and there is still debris at the bottom of the pool. In all fairness, the pool hasn’t been vacuumed most of the winter, but it is also screened in! The new 2023 model doesn’t get the corners, can’t go up my small incline and the deeper end still have debris. As you can see in the pictures, it’s not a huge pool. I really wanted to love this, but I don’t.Pro:-Love the new look and the power button on the top of the 2023.-It was nicely packaged-Was excited to see it came with extra parts.The price was $299 and I was able to purchase it for $200, not a bad price.-customer service is exceptionalCons:-Only cleans the deeper end.-Can not go up the 2-3” incline.-Doesn’t go up the sides or get the corners.- Even though the look has improved, the quality has decreased.Unfortunately, I’m going to return it. $200 for a vacuum that only cleans 45% of the pool isn’t practical.I would love to see if the next model up is better quality but it’s not in my price point at the moment.I guess I’m going to have to fight pool dirt and crime alone."
