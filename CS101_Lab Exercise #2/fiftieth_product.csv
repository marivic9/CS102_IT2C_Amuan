"4","ThermoPro TP65B Digital Wireless Hygrometer Indoor Outdoor",NA,"Anthony","Reviewed in Australia on 18 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Device can connect up to 3x external  sensors: I bought it with one additional sensor and have now purchased an additional sensor for a total of 3x external sensors plus the base station.Have one of the sensors measuring outdoor temperature and humidity and the other two inside guitar cases keeping an eye on humidity levels there. The outdoor readings are always in agreement with the numbers reported by Bureau Of Meteorology (Australia's national weather, climate and water agency) for my location, so I'm confident in their accuracy."

I use it everyday and have found both the inside and outside temperature & humidity readings to be accurate and reliable. The batteries last many months before needing replacing. I had a small cosmetic issue with my original unit and the customer service provided by ThermoPro was fantastic."
