"6","XLUX Soil Moisture Sensor Meter Water Monitor, Hygrometer for Gardening, Farming,Plants, No Batteries Required, 2 Pack",NA,"FLW",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","as the instructions include to clean it off after use don't need water getting in it and ruining this product seems to work pretty accurate I have been using it a long while now. Now that I am more educating in using it and detecting the humidity I don't use it so often but I do on occasion. definitely worth the money"
"7","XLUX Soil Moisture Sensor Meter Water Monitor, Hygrometer for Gardening, Farming,Plants, No Batteries Required, 2 Pack",NA,"FLW",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I don't typically review products until I've had/used them for awhile (several months) but doing this one early.So far, so good: I think the meter is accurate. It has seems to have help me save one of my fiddle leaf figs from root rot (I had this fiddle leaf on the same watering schedule as the fiddle leaf right next to it - which is doing amazing - yet the same schedule caused root rot to set in in this fiddle leaf).I will say that the watering guide printed on the box does not make a whole lot of sense, depending on how you interpret it. It is not consistent. Is it tell you when to water? Or what level of moisture to water to? (level to keep soil at). Either way, you will see that there are mistakes for certain plants.If you interpret the guide as tell you where the plant likes to be BEFORE you water it again, then here are some of the mistakes I see:  the sansevieria plant (snake plant or ""mother-in-law's tongue"") - this plant is DEFINITELY a red zone plant. It likes dry conditions most of the time, somewhat like a cactus. If you kept this plant's soil in the suggested zone (green zone 6-7), as the guide suggests, you will quickly rot the roots and kill this plant. I also think the same is true for the ponytail plant. It likes to get to dry soil before the next watering occurs. But the opposite is true for the umbrella tree (listed as red zone plant). This ""cousin"" of the fiddle leaf fig does NOT like it's soil to ever become completely dry (unlike the fiddle leaf which should be firmly in the red zone before watering again). The umbrella tree likes to have it's soil just shy of being completely dry before receiving a ""deep watering"" (I'm guessing when the soil is at a moisture level of about 4-5 or a bit less is okay too; it can survive being in the red zone - it just doesn't love it and it lets you know by its drooping leaves).I'm not sure how many other flaws there might be in this guide, as I am not familiar with every type of plant listed but - if you interpret it as I am - it seems that a lot of the recommendations are correct. Personally, I would still look-up (google search) the water requirements of each individual plant. The vast majority of houseplants should be dry (in the red zone) before watering if you want to avoid root rot. Many plants can be saved from dryness (under-watering) but it is VERY difficult to save a plant from root rot (over-watering)."
"8","XLUX Soil Moisture Sensor Meter Water Monitor, Hygrometer for Gardening, Farming,Plants, No Batteries Required, 2 Pack",NA,"Nancy Badillo",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I spent a lot of money on some beautiful house plants and I really want to see them thrive. a few of the house plant websites I follow recommended getting a water meter so I bought this one off Amazon. I chose it because of its extra long length. I have palm trees and others that are in very tall pots.I love having useful tools like this! Several times I have thought my plant needed water, but then the gauge tells me that the soil is quite wet, several inches in. It’s been several months and my plants look fantastic. No yellow leaves… No brown leaves… I’ve got this watering thing down pat now. :-)It doesn’t cost much and I’m sure it will save me lots of money in NOT replacing plants."
"9","XLUX Soil Moisture Sensor Meter Water Monitor, Hygrometer for Gardening, Farming,Plants, No Batteries Required, 2 Pack",NA,"Cary",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've used this moisture meter many times now as I consider myself to still be a novice plant parent/gardener. It has really, really helped me to know what dry actually is because I came from a place of never having grown anything myself before in my life and spent a long time thinking that when the soil was damp but not wet that it was dry enough for watering! This caused me to constantly over water my plants! I've gotten better at telling now but sometimes I worry the soil is too wet for watering so I double check with this meter, or if I just lotioned my hands or otherwise don't want to stick a finger in the dirt, I have checked the accuracy of this meter enough times that I trust the reading and it has been quite adequate for me!"
"10","XLUX Soil Moisture Sensor Meter Water Monitor, Hygrometer for Gardening, Farming,Plants, No Batteries Required, 2 Pack",NA,"444phish",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This products works just as I would expect it to. I’m really glad I bought it. I recently purchased some new house plants and the nursery repotted them for me before leaving. The assistant said she did not water them because of adding extra weight and the plants possibly leaking in my car but the they probably needed watering within a few days. Because I have been known to overwater my plants, I purchased this hygrometer. If I had not had this, I would have overwatered these too! One plant I actually didn’t water for two more weeks! For me, this is a great product."
