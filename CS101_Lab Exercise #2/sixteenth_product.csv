"4","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"kennyd1gital","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"Digital hygrometers are nothing new to me; I use them in several areas throughout my home. What is new, however, is having one with such a large, easy to read display. I can easily read the display on the LICHI Digital Hygrometer from across the room. Iâ€™ve also not previously used a digital hygrometer with a backlit display. The backlight is activated by a capacitive touch sensor at the top of the frame and makes it easy to read the large display in low-light or no-light conditions. The daily high and low readings for humidity and temperature are a great added feature and one you wonâ€™t typically find on the average budget digital hygrometer. The feature set rounds out with a low battery indicator (which is another thing you wonâ€™t find on other simple digital hygrometers), so you know when itâ€™s time to replace the batteries (it takes three AAA batteries) well before the display goes blank. The only way I was able to test it for accuracy was to compare it to the readings on other hygrometers I own, but it was always in agreement with the others when I checked it while conducting this test; it seems to be accurate from what I am able to determine.Using the LICHI Digital Hygrometer is simple and intuitive. Really, you just put batteries in and it starts doing what you need it to do right away, which is display the current humidity and temperature (although you should give it several minutes to stabilize before considering the current reading accurate). There are three buttons on the back for clearing the stored daily high/low values, changing from ÂºF to ÂºC and vice versa, and resetting the unit to the factory default setting. Another feature I appreciate is the option to either mount the unit to the wall via the keyhole slot in the top rear of the frame, or having it rest on a shelf, countertop, or other flat surface using the integrated pop-out stand. The stand is spring-loaded to the open position, so thereâ€™s very little chance of it toppling over from bumps against the surface itâ€™s resting on; itâ€™s sturdy.Overall, I find the LICHI Digital Hygrometer to be an excellent choice when it comes to monitoring temperature and humidity throughout the home. While simple in design, it still offers a nice set of features that sets it ahead of the other digital hygrometers I own. If you are in need of temperature and humidity monitoring, I would definitely recommend this product!"
"5","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Matt&Rachel Harris","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I got this unit for use in my poultry brooder. Keeping the temperature and humidity dialed in is crucial for several of the birds I raise. This is a simple and easy to use unit that requires no set-up. Simply add batteries and it's good to go. It is quite accurate for both temp and humidity and updates every few seconds. The backlit feature (turns on with a touch sensor at the top of the unit) is great for checking it in the dark without disturbing the birds too much, and it makes it simple to read, even for my old and nightblind eyes! I love that it also shows the highs and lows, so that I can see at a glance if my temp or humidity has gotten out of desired range. At less than $15, this unit is also a great value. Highly recommend!!"
"6","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"wills_dad","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"With home automation and USB rechargable objects becoming more and more common, it is 'nice' to find something that quietly does its job and does not require a cord.I like to know that my thermostat is working keeping my home at a comfortable temperature range - even if I happen to be away from home.  This 'thermometer' does that quietly and effectively.  It will record the temperature range (high/low) for whatever period you are interested in.  This can be especially handy if there is some question if the heating/cooling equipment in an area may not be performing correctly.This also has a hygrometer (humidity) register that also provides high/low reading for the same place.  This is also of interest to me in that in the winter, the indoor humidity levels can drop.  Very low (or high) indoor humidity can be damaging to wood furniture and even the wood structure of a home/building.There are handy 'reset' and F/C buttons on the back.  The reason I say they are handy is that while you may be doing periodic resets of this measuring device, the other button is typically a setup operation and would not be used regularly afterwards.The actual device has a black rim around the face.  The display is the grey displays that you find on many LCD displays.  The back of the device is a white - not bright white though.  There is a pull out 'easel' that is on the back if you want to stand it up.  It will also operate laying down as long as you lay it on a hard surface (it needs air flow to do the measurements).The overall size is comparable to a smart phone."

"9","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Chris Klinger","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I got this to settle some  disputes about temperatures in the office.  A number of folks kept telling me the thermostat in our office area was wrong, and it was colder than it read.  This little guy showed them it was actually right.Display is large and easy to read, and the light feature is nice to change up the contrast even more, making reading even easier.  Seems to be accurate as it is matching up with other temp devices.  Very happy with this little device."
"10","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Jennifer M.","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I like how compact this is but you can still see the numbers. It tells temperature and humidity. Appears to be accurate."
"11","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Balanced View","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars",NA,"This is a nice looking device to read humidity and temperature in a room.  The large font and lit background (need to pressure a light bulb icon on the top) makes it easy to read.  Although, I wish the lit surface would stay longer than 10 seconds.  Itâ€™s powered by 3 AAA batteries which are not included in the packaging.The unit measures changes in humidity and temperature very responsively.  I took it from room to room to test the temperature differences and to the bathroom after showering to test the humidity level.  I will use it primary to test the humidity in the bathrooms in order to prevent mold growth.  I do this by using a timer on a floor fan to blow dry.  This unit is very good for telling me how long to leave the floor fan on so the bathroom humidity can be lowered to a safe target %.In the winter time I intend on using it in the office to see if I need a humidifier before getting into trouble with dry skin and nose bleeds.  For the price itâ€™s actually a very useful and elegant looking device. I would recommend it."
"12","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Moonjo","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I gave only for stars for the accuracy because I don't really have anything to verify the readings against other than a very old analog meter and my home thermostat. None of the readings match up. But I do feel the Hygrometer is the most accurate. The display is big enough to see from across a small room and it was very easy to setup. What I appreciate the most is the fact the hygrometer actually uses AAA batteries. No USB cord needed to charge and no built in non-removable rechargeable batteries used. I know that may sound anti-eco/green but I think devices like these should last well beyond the lifetime of built in rechargeable batteries. It would have been a shame to throw the entire unit out just because I couldn't replace the battery. And of course I can still used rechargeable AAA batteries as well. Overall happy with the purchase but I may get a different unit just to judge the accuracy of the readings."
"13","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"MsKi77en","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I've always wanted a hygrometer to measure the humidity in my house, most especially during winter.  Most of the time, I just forget about them until it shows up again.  This one shows what I need - the temperature and humidity of my living room, which doesn't have the best vents from my central air.  It's also where my hoard of plants remain during the winter months, so making sure the humidity is good means a lot to me.  Not only will it benefit my plants, it will also help me decide if I need a different humidifier.It seems to be quite sensitive because if you pick it up and hold it with just your fingers, your body heat affects the humidity and temperature reading almost immediately.  This gives me more comfort in believing that the readings are accurate.The only thing I can do without is the averages.  I don't have much use for the lowest or the highest of each reading.  Oh, and the little smiley face that's on it.  Honestly, it's beyond unnecessary.  What's comfortable according to the emoji isn't what everyone else will or won't think is comfortable."
"14","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Rex C.","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I imagined this to be several times larger than it actually is. The pictures clearly state it is 3.5""x5"", so that is my mistake.That said, I do like it. The portability is nice, the screen is clear and easy to read. It is simple to use - a great gift for family and friends from young adult to senior citizens."

I'm very pleased with the performance of this digital hygrometer and consider it an excellent value!"
"16","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Joseph in New Hampshire","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I like that this little unit has a back stand that can be deployed for using it on a flat surface, it can also be hung on a wall.  It's of a good size so the numbers can be read easily.  Both the temperature and humidity ""High,Low"" levels are captured so the daily ranges can be viewed.  It also has a reset button to clear those captured ranges and start over.  There is a touch light that turns on the backlight for 10 seconds so it can be read in the dark. (See picture).  Winter is coming and with the heat turned on the humidity level can become bone dry in no time.  To keep my dog's fur and my skin from drying out it's good to know the humidity level so I can adjust my humidifiers accordingly and stay comfortable..."
"17","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Joseph in New Hampshire","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"easy to set up. On the front there is a lightbulb icon at the top of the device that turns on the panel light for easy reading, although it doesnâ€™t stay on very long. Buttons on the back provide easy setup of preferences. There is a foot stand on the back that makes it a desktop item, or it can be hung on a wall with a nail support. Requires 3 AAA batteries."
"18","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"D2E","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I ordered this for a guest bedroom that sometimes has different temperature and humidity levels than the rest of the house.  This is an attractive device that I have mounted on the wall right next to the light switch.I compared the reading on this unit to that on a more expensive Accurite sensor, and the readings were exactly the same.  I like the Accurite a bit more because the numerals are easier to read with a lighter background than this.  However, this unit has larger digits, and there is a light that requires a touch at the top of the unit if I'm having trouble reading the numbers.This sensor runs on 3 AAA batteries.  I'm happy with the accuracy of this sensor and also the price at $17"
"19","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"FunLuvr","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"This thermometer and humidity reader is working very well for me, all I had to do was put in 3 AAA batteries and it immediately turned on and started working. It seems accurate as much as I can tell. It has a nice feature of a little face that tells you how comfortable that reading is. If you touch the button on the top the screen lights up, but it doesn't stay lit up. It has a little kick stand in the back to prop it up, as well as a hole where you could hang it from a push pin or nail."
"20","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Lauren Phillips","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I got this for the back of my work van so I can keep a eye on the temperatures and take breaks inside.  So far it's worked really well! It's also opened my eyes to how quickly temperatures rise in the back of my cargo van.  I wish I had it sooner so I could have seen just how severe it was when we were having the record highs this summer.  It has a little pull out stand to prop it up or a single hole of hanging it on a screw.  If it's not well lit to read the display there's a touch sensitive backlight button on the top of the display."
"21","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"Grc-N-Mrcy","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars",NA,"This thermometer has been a good addition to my office.  I have two big windows that add heat to my office during the day and this helps me to know how warm it is in my office.  That coupled with being able to see how humid (or not) it is helps me to know if I need to turn on my humidifier.  I am certainly glad for this little addition.  It helps me keep my office comfortable."
"22","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"HI@PNW","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"I've always yearned for a way to check the humidity level without relying on my smartphone. This device required 3 AAA batteries to kickstart, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was effortlessly ready. The display is straightforward and requires no adjustments, which I appreciate. The backlit feature is a delightful addition, as it provides a bright and clear reading. Overall, this product strikes me as elegantly simple, making it a practical addition to any home."
"23","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"HI@PNW","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"You will need three AAA batteries to get the unit working. Not provided.  Once they were in, the display showed the humidity and temperature.It has a sensor because as I was holding it the humidity changed. What I find interesting is that it will tell you the highs and lows in a 24 hour period.I got this for the classroom and the temperature has been brutal. I'd like to see how this thermometer performs in my room."

Works great and is accurate.  It is a bit larger than others Iâ€™ve seen which makes it so much easier to read and it even has a light which I LOVE.  Takes three AAA batteries (not included).  It has a little flip out stand as well which is super convenient.  Love it!"
