"1","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Brilliant caught a lot of bugs","Donna",NA,"4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Have caught dozens of those little horrible flies that buzz around you and get all in your face. Stick it near your plants and you should see good results!I used a sticky note and attached the trap to it as if you place it on your wall raw it can rip paint off the walls."
"2","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Great product","Aaron",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Works well"
"3","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Very effective !","David",NA,"3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Dealing with a pretty significant infestation of fungus gnats ! the sticky pads are working well ."
"4","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","It does catch the bugs.","Amazon Customer",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I love that these are easy to use and they do catch the gnats that are so annoying.  I'm not crazy about the butterfly shape because it wants to tear as I remove the paper."
"5","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Solved our gnat problem","Mark Graf",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I love house plants and over the years I've acquired around 30. That is great but then the tiny little annoying bugs started showing up. I looked at fancier electric solution but thought I would try these and I am so glad I did. I put them in the plants I knew the little bugs love in no time they were covered with them I now I don't find any around the house. So happy to find a cheap and easy solution."
"6","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Traps for real!","Donna Skinner",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I have around 60 plants in my house, no cats though. Great for trapping and easy to use. 10/10 did buy again."
"7","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Worked OK, but didnt solve problem","ConcernedCitizen",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","While these were sticky and thus caught many gnats, they didnt stop them form reproducing. I just added sand above the top layer of soil (sand acts as a barrier to gnats from laying eggs/larvae in the soil). The sand stopped more gnats from multiplying."
"8","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Works","Cristal",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Recommended by my granddaughter, who is a microbiologist. It works and the design and color are perky and fun"
"9","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","DIE DIE DIE","jessica",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This killed so many fungus gnat adults in my indoor houseplants. But, not at the rate they breed, no matter how many I put out.You NEED to use this in conjunction with BTI/mosquito dunks which only kills larvae/eggs. This will cut down the adult numbers buzzing around but if you don't cull the jedi younglings you will never bring balance to the force."
"10","Stingmon 12 Pack Sticky Fruit Fly Fungus","Solved a problem","phoebe",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We had a terrible gnat problem in our kitchen this past summer. I have lots of plants on my window sil so I put one of these in pretty much every plant pot, and over time it really did capture most of the gnats. We also had a light to attract them with more sticky stuff. I like that I didn't have to use anything too invasive or chemicals. When you're done just throw it away. They're very sticky and effective."
