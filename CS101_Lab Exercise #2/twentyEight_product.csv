"3","Hills 100728 Garden Sprayer",NA,"Philips soda bottles","Reviewed in Australia on 24 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've had cheaper brands from Bunnings that just didn't cut it - they were either too big and heavy, didn't pump well, easily clogged etc. This one is perfect.
