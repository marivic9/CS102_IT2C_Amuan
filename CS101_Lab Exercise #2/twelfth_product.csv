With 15 mins of putting the stakes in, there were 20+ knats stuck. They have helped to identify what plants were worse and I've been able to dump the dirt and replant in sterile soil.The sticky stakes are double sided and quite large. When I go to replace them, I will cut them in half lengthwise.  Best to tilt the sticky part away from the plant because it will rip leaves if they get stuck."
