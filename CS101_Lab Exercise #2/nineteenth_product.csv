"1","Super Ninja Fruit Fly Trap - 4 Traps - Highly Effective Ecological Fruit Fly Traps Indoor - Environmentally Responsible Fruit Fly Killer - User Friendly - Up to 3 Weeks per Bottle","Uitstekende prijs/kwaliteit","Sharleen Holmes","Reviewed in Australia on 4 February 2024","3.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Had tried everything but couldn't get rid of the fruit flies.. bought 2 packs of 4 and placed them in odd places around the house, 3 in the kitchen, and 5 around the rest of the house. Overnight they practically disappeared. They are small bottles but effective, slight apple cider vinegar type of scent but not overpowering. Will be buying more to store just in case for future!"

"4","Super Ninja Fruit Fly Trap - 4 Traps - Highly Effective Ecological Fruit Fly Traps Indoor - Environmentally Responsible Fruit Fly Killer - User Friendly - Up to 3 Weeks per Bottle","Best of all product","Sharleen Holmes","Reviewed in Australia on 11 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've made homemade fruit fly traps to no avail. This product really works! My refrigerator went out and leaked underneath, just enough to provide a breeding ground for these nasty critters. And they must have found other places, because they just kept coming and coming, in droves. I tried all sorts of remedies and finally I found these. I bought one and within days, it was literally filled with insects, so I bought another one. In a couple of days that was full, as well. I now have 3-4 strategically placed and the difference it's made is enormous. I went from literally hundreds of these fruit flies to almost none in just over a week or so. I mean, I had so many that I literally couldn't even eat a meal, even in the living room. I was killing 15-20 of them in an evening. People said to spray alcohol on them - that did nothing. Cider vinegar did nothing. This is the only thing that worked and I can't recommend it enough. $5 might seem pricey for the tiny bottle you get, but it's well worth the peace of mind you get in return when you're not battling swarms of fruit flies and know they're dying in that little bottle on the counter! I'll keep using these until they're all gone and keep a few on hand for any future outbreaks. I figure once the population thins out enough, they'll breed less and eventually they'll be gone. Finding out where they're still breeding is the remaining thing I have to do, but in the meantime, I feel like I've gotten my house back from them!UPDATE: I've been using these things for months. I can't find where these things are breeding, but I'm going to be looking for a new product. The last few I purchased just don't seem to be attracting the fruit flies like the previous batches. I've also noticed that some bottles are darker than others and some are filled with more liquid than others. I'm not sure if they're being watered down or what, but the last couple batches were not as effective and don't seem to be attracting the fruit flies. Plus, when I first started purchasing them the price was $4.99 per bottle. Then I saw some for 4 bottles for $11.99, but before I could order them the listing disappeared. Then the price went up to $6.99 for one bottle, but there was also a listing for 2 bottles for $7.99 (those were the batches that were weaker and not as effective). Now I see the price is up to $7.99 for just one bottle! I think that's pretty high, considering the last few batches I purchased weren't strong enough to attract the fruit flies. Very disappointed in the change in effectiveness and higher prices."

Auch wenn die preislich etwas teurer als z.B. die klebenden Fruchtfliegenfallen von DM sind, ist diese Falle super wirksam. Die Falle haben wir direkt in der Küche neben unserem Obst aufgestellt. Nachdem diese dort 1 Tag stand, waren wir etwas enttäuscht, da noch keine Fliege sich für diese Falle interessierte. Aber nach 2-3 Tagen waren bereits etliche Fliegen in der Falle, und nach ca. 1 Woche waren wir alle Fliegen los.Die Falle kann man mit dem mitgelieferten doppelseitigem Klebeband eigentliche überall hinkleben wo man möchte."

Unfortunately my neighbours are scruffs and don't empty the kitchen bins after themselves.This left an opening for hundreds of fruit flies. It was that bad they were getting inside the cupboards, in the fridge, and in my room.So I purchased just one of these and stuck it the wall close to the kitchen. It had a sweet smell of vinegar which attracts the midgies.For the 1st day I thought it wasn't working as I didn't see and fruit flies going near it. But the second day.. Loads. So now instead of them sneaking through the gaps in my door, they were going for this.I can't stop the scruffy neighbours from being lazy but I can stop the flies from entering where I don't want them.This little bottle last a long time. Well over a month"

I decided to give them a shot, and boy, was I in for a surprise!The traps are supposed to last about three weeks, and guess what? They delivered exactly as promised. I set one up, and within a short period, it started to work its magic. It caught so many flies, it was like a ninja stealthily taking them down one by one. I was both amazed and grossed out by the number of little buzzers it managed to trap. Eww, fruit flies, you've met your match! I totally forgot about one of the traps I had set. It stayed in my kitchen for way longer than it should have. When I finally stumbled upon it, let me tell you, it was a sight to behold. The flies that were caught in that trap had turned into some kind of bizarre, melted fly art.Of course, at that point, the trap had done its job and was no longer catching any more flies, as one would expect. I'm buying more of these Super Ninja Fruit Fly Traps. They proved their effectiveness, and I'm ready to tackle any future fruit fly invasions with my trusty ninja traps."

"24","Super Ninja Fruit Fly Trap - 4 Traps - Highly Effective Ecological Fruit Fly Traps Indoor - Environmentally Responsible Fruit Fly Killer - User Friendly - Up to 3 Weeks per Bottle","Klein aber fein!","Amanda-Jayne Lovett-Sasse","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Diese kleine Fruchtfliegenfalle sieht schick aus und wirkt tatsächlich sofort! Schon kurz nach dem Aufstellen fliegen die ersten Fruchtfliegen hinein! Das Abtrocknen des Trichters ist zu empfehlen, da die Fliegen sonst erst auf dem Trichter sitzen, bevor sie hinein fliegen. Der Lockstoff wirkt sehr gut und er stinkt überhaupt nicht! Erst wenn man direkt an der Öffnung riecht, riecht es angenehm nach süßen Äpfeln und leicht nach Essig. Ansonsten riecht man die Falle nicht. Da sich bei mir die Fruchtfliegen vor allem im Mülleimer vermehren, habe ich die Falle außen an den Mülleimer geklebt. Sie hebt sehr gut. Ich werfe sie nach Gebrauch nicht weg. Der Trichter lässt sich leicht entfernen, dann kann man die Falle gut reinigen und mit gekauftem oder selbst gemachtem Lockstoff neu befüllen. Mein selbst gemachter Lockstoff ist zwar nicht ganz so gut wie der original von SuperNinja, er wirkt aber trotzdem ganz gut. Für meinen selbst gemachten Lockstoff nehme ich Apfelsaft mit einem kleinen Schuss Apfelessig und 1 winzigen Tropfen Spüli."

It works!","Enomis","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","For some reason we had like an infestation of fruit flies, even when I removed all the fruit from the kitchen I couldn’t get rid of them, it was really horrible and annoying as they were flying around and even though I killed many a day they just kept appearing. The spray for insect Reid didn’t work at all. I sprayed it and next day there was again like 15 fruit flies. So I tried and bought this product, hoping it’ll help but didn’t have a massive expectation. Anyway, I opened it and next day a realised that I don’t see them flying around very much, one or two here and there and I look at the bottle and I was shocked to see how much flies were in it ! Yuk! I read they like fruit vinegar so I poured apple cider vinegar to small cups just little bit is enough and put the little sticker traps inside a cup and also cought a lot. Cheaper than this little bottle but this product is smarter looking and not as obvious as you don’t have a look at dead flies haha. I highly recommend this , I will be buying more to have in stock ."

I’m inundated with fruit flies (thanks Ocado for the rotten bananas fresh they were not!) anyway put one down near the cat food, cleared all surfaces, put one on other side of kitchen, one in the hall and one in the lounge.  Hall one seemed to catch a few, kitchen one a few but the one near the cat food - BAM that thing is completely rammed full of dead fruit flies.  Cats happy and I am happy too.The ones elsewhere are catching them but there aren’t as many.  I considered emptying a bottle and reusing it after but that thing is so full of dead flies I’m not going near it.  Expensive as they might be they 100% work so makes them entirely worth it.I will continue to battle with the wee beggers till they’re all gone.  Honestly, I’m gonna get more of these to have ready for the next time Ocado send me rotting fruit - maybe I can charge them to cover the cost!"

My preference is to open the window and usher them out but overnight they seem to be some kind of SAS Ninja fruit flies that sneak back in and hide in an invisible part of my kitchen and appear the following morning!I've tried the sticky catchers and although they catch a few, they are nowhere near as effective as this little bottle. It's discreet, inoffensive and a superb little buy. I've stuck it next to the compost bin and the huge reduction in the little blighters is evident.It took a couple of days (no idea why) but it's captured quite a few now. It's been stuck on there for a good few weeks now and the adhesive is strong and it's stayed put. I'll be replacing it with a fresh one soon."

I've still left it on the side to try and trap any stragglers that may have been missed in the original purge."

Diese kleinen Plagegeister schienen überall zu sein und waren wirklich nervig. Aber nachdem ich diese 4er Packung Fruchtfliegenfallen ausprobiert habe, bin ich wirklich beeindruckt.Die Anwendung war denkbar einfach. Ich habe einfach eine Falle geöffnet, den Lockstoff aktiviert und sie in meiner Küche platziert. Schon nach kurzer Zeit konnte ich beobachten, wie die Fruchtfliegen angezogen wurden und in die Falle geflogen sind. Es war wirklich erstaunlich zu sehen, wie effektiv diese Fallen waren.Nach ein paar Tagen waren die Fruchtfliegen nahezu verschwunden, und ich konnte endlich meine Küche wieder in Ruhe genießen. Diese Fruchtfliegenfallen haben mir wirklich geholfen, das Problem schnell und effizient zu lösen. Ich kann sie daher jedem empfehlen, der mit Fruchtfliegen zu kämpfen hat."

Die Falle steht seit einer Woche bei uns in der Küche und im Wohnzimmer und ich muss sagen die Fruchtfliegen sind fast alle weg. Ab und zu sieht man noch eine aber sonst sind alle in die Falle geflogen. Einfach genial das Produkt 👍👍👍"
