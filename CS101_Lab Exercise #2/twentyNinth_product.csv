"9","TAKRINK Humane Mouse Trap",NA,"Librarian guy","Reviewed in Australia on 4 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","They're very easy to use. First day, all baits were eaten but no mouse was trapped. I assumed the mice were to light to set off. I improvised by sticking a coin on the trap, so with just a slight addition to the weight will set it off. Second day with the improvised, caught 2 small mice. Today's the 3rd day, and has a caught a mouse. Bait used is a piece of bread. Works wonderful"
