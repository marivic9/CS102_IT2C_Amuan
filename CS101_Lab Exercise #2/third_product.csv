"5","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Tabby",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","It’s very powerful and sometimes I think that it’s even too strong, especially when a fly gets stuck there and catches fire lol… Also, it has a great battery life and could be charged with a micro USB cable, so no additional batteries.But the most important thing I like about it is that it’s universal in use. You can swing it left and right like a regular fly swatter, or you can put it on a table, turn on a small mesmerizing light and the flies will fly to it themselves. That’s so smart!"
"6","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Patel",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I love this zapper!  A friend has one that doesn't include the light or stand and his doesn't compare.  Using a traditional ""fly swatter"" is frustrating as you have to be quick, accurate and beat the fast insect.  I tried using this without the light on and without the charger/stand.  That was not successful since this isn't flexible and insects move so fast.  Insects are attracted to the light, so I leave it in the stand (the battery life is short if not in the charging base), set it with the light on and place the base in a dark area.  This attracts any flying insects and I hear the insects meeting their death.  A video review showed someone placing a napkin under the stand and showing viewers the numerous flying insects that fell to their death thanks to this device.  To satisfy my curiosity and for the ease of clean up, I keep a napkin under the stand.  It amazes me how many small flying insects get in our house simply because we open the door briefly, especially at night.  I might be purchasing another to place near another entrance.  If I had to give anything negative about this, it would be that the most effective time is after dark.  But, it works fine near a television and lamp, so I truly have nothing negative to say.  You won't regret purchasing this!"

"11","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Bee Boi",NA,"4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I bought this because my last battery operated zapper died and in summer we always have a large amount of flies during BBQ and some stray ones always get into the house. We love it!  First of all , it felt sturdier compared to my last one, and I love it is rechargeable with a stand, with a setting  that allows you to have it on all the time if you want. And when it zaps , it  REALLY zaps them dead with a solid shock, or if you didn't hit them right on, will usually stun them enough that they are going in circles and you can easily kill them after.  Sometimes when we get an infestation of fruit flies, we just leave it on the whole night and whenever we hear a loud 'zap' from the kitchen, it makes us gleeful, I know very morbid.And the setting that allows it on all the time is great because when you are chasing down a fly, sometimes that split second extra time you take to press the shock button can mean a difference between zapping the fly or seeing it laugh at you as it gets away.Last week, we had a BBQ with mussels and the stinky shells were attracting the entire neighbourhood of flies, so what we did was place the discarded shells in a wide bowl and laid this little zapper across the bowl with it on. And next thing you know, flies are literally kamikaze-ing into it to try to get to the shells! I wished we took pictures, but by the end of dinner, the zapper is entirely black with smoked flies and we counted at least 100 dead!!!! That was great as this week for July 4th when we had a bbq for friends, there were no more flies! (At least for a while, until a new batch hatches). But we will be ready for it. Btw,  watching flies kill themselves on the zapper was also quite the dinner entertainment, it was like a spectator sport with 'Ooos' and 'Wows' from everyone. Love this zapper, I would give 10 stars for the first time for a purchase on Amazon!!Footnote: since the netting was blackened with flies after the first massacre, I rinsed it carefully and brushed off the debris with some soap and water, let it dry overnight to be safe, then charged it, and it works with no issues!"

"15","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Laurie",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I purchased a home this summer, a brand-new build. The construction workers were in and out all summer, leaving doors and windows open constantly, and the lot is right next to a large pond. When I moved into my home, we had a lot of flies and gnats and baby dragonflies buzzing around inside.I purchased this zapper and placed it on a table on the stand and just left it on 24/7. It works great! It zapped bugs constantly and if I saw a fly when I was in the room, I was able to grab the zapper and get it right then and there. Our home is now free of all bugs and pests, but I still leave this plugged in because it'll catch any strays that happen to come inside every now and then.As an added bonus, it's actually an attractive item to just have sitting on a table. It doesn't look out of place at all. I've had several people comment on it and say that they're going to purchase one of their own. I highly recommend this, I love it! I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."

I have tried cleaning everything including the inside of our garbage disposale flange . I have deep cleaned drains , garbage and recycle cans . I have sprayed my counters with hydrogen peroxide , I have kept all drains in our bathoom / kitchen areas plugged. They just keep coming back . All of the sprays and traps all reviews are mixed about success .The reviews on this item all were good so I ordered the double set. The first charge took 6 hours , its all lit up and as soon as I walked into a swarm of fruit flies the snap pop pop was so happy to my ears .  After I killed some in the kitchen bathroom hallway I took it out side on our porch area and layed it on my table as I played on my phone . I forgot about the lights that attract the bugs all on its own. It was like the 4th of july on the swatter , all of these bugs comited ending of their time on earth by jumping onto my bug swatter as it just laid on my table.

"22","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Mjk",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","These zap bugs dead!  I’ve got two of them — one out on our patio deck and one in the kitchen — where flies seem to live!  I can swing it at them or they often volunteer to run into it while sitting in the table!  Works wonders.  We have a lot of mosquitoes as well — and I hate it when they get inside the house."
"23","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Grace Burrowes",NA,"3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This unit is great because it's rechargeable so you can plug it in with any USBC cable and charge it (comes with USBC chargung cable). It also comes with solar panel that will charge it during the day so it can run at night too (thanks to built in battery) and in my experience it worked from sunset for about 6 hours before it turned off and turned back on in the morning when sun came out. If I had it off, it may have worked even longer hours but I had it on during the day so it was draining power all day even before sunset and my panel isn't even in full sun, it's under the table and gets partial shade from the chair legs and plants around it. I have it installed outside where I don't have a power plug nearby and it's basically fire and forget. You leave it out there and it's always working, free. No electricity cost (my area Powe is $0.74/kWh ouch). I placed it under the table where we sit outside and our legs get bit all the time, now we hear the lovely sound of zapped flying bugs that we can't even see but get bit from them all the time. With this unit working outdoors, hopefully that problem is solved for good."

I am thrilled that we could NOT find a decent deal on a decent old fashioned fly swatter.  This thing is like taking an electric tennis racket to the flys...then at night you just leave it in its stand does your flying pest hunting for you while you sleep.We were also having trouble on our deck with yellow jackets.  Our pest control company could not find their nest and said we have a playground for them in our yard....you know, birdbaths, bird feeders, hummingbird feeders flowers etc. All the things we've have for at least a decade with no yellow jackets but for some reason they've decided now that our place is THE place to be.  My husband got stung and it was extremely painful.  It bothered him for a week.  Now this is a guy who periodically walks up to me with blood running down his arm not realizing he's somehow cut himself.  Anyway, back to the yellow jackets.  We were having so much trouble killing those things with our one good fly swatter (that we usually end up searching an hour to find) however yesterday, with our new modern giant fly swatter, we killed two in no time."

"27","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"danawest8831",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","These rechargeable bug zapping rackets are high quality and have bright UV lights for night time zapping fun of mosquitos. The base stands have the charging unit in them. Instead of connecting the usb cable to the handle the cable connects to the base stand. The usb cable and base stand are included with the bug zapper racket. There are two modes of operation, either manual or automatic. In manual mode the UV light is not lit and you have to press the button on the handle to have zapping power. This mode is good for daytime use when zapping flies. At night time the best mode is automatic which turns on the UV lights and the zapper is on all the time. This mode is deadly on those pesky mosquitos who are attracted to the UV lights. In this mode you can also leave the zapper in the stand overnight for zapping bugs all night long, however it is quite loud when one gets zapped. The handle is round on the racket versus others that are oval shaped and the button is large and easy to push on the back of the handle with the palm of your hand. These bug zapper rackets are higher quality made than others I have seen and more heavy duty so they should last a long time. I highly recommend them to everyone else who want to get rid of pesky flying insects and have fun doing it all at the same time!"
"28","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Ben",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We have had and used a tennis racket like fly zapper for many years, but the slots allowed anything smaller than a large fly to slip through unscathed.  With fruit flies, gnats, those bugs that seem to spend their summers circling the middle of any room with an open door, etc..., we were stuck.  That is until we bought the Palone Electric Fly Swatter.  This has been amazing.  SO AMAZING that I ordered one for both of my parents (they are divorced).  This kills all insects in its path and none get a free ride slipping through the slots.  It is stylish as well - enough so to just leave it on its charger in the kitchen area.  Ease of use is also outstanding - just pull it from the charging base, flip a switch and it is good to go.  Even in the charging base, you can leave it on with the purple light and it will attract and kill bugs, including mosquitos.  I cannot recommend this more strongly.  Love it!!!!"
"29","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"Amazon Customer",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I used this swatter against fruit flies, and it works great.  For large and slow-moving flies, I manage to hit them about 75% of the time.  The others times they manage to evade me and fly into areas that are too small to fit the swatter.  Once they hit the swatter, I can always hear a loud and satisfying ""pop"" noise.  Sometimes I hear 4 or 5 pops in a row when engaging multiple flies!  They never fly through the swatter without getting zapped.I have a harder time getting the smaller and fast-moving flies.  However I can often get those if I allow them to land on a surface, and then position the swatter directly above them and bring it down towards them.  They almost always fly up into the swatter and I don't have to wave the swatter around at all.  I have not used the ""light"" feature to attract flies, and so far I have come after them.I have two very minor complaints about the product: 1) The base is not very stable, and 2) the product does not look like it could be easily taken apart to replace a worn-out battery.  But it does seem like a well-made product that should last for a while.  It is a lot of fun to use!"
"30","PALONE Electric Fly Swatter 3000V Bug Zapper Racket 2 in 1 Fly Swatter with 1200mAh Battery",NA,"TigerFish",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This is my second type of electric racket and I have to say that I’m impressed. While it may not fry every thing in sight, it does give quite a few satisfying “pops” to indicate it’s doing its job. Love having this on hand when the swarm of gnats follow during our walks in the park or out in the backyard. The push button is at an awkward spot for me because when I have it on the automatic mode with lights, I keep pressing on it while I hold. Keep in mind, the snaps of death are not quiet and there will be sparks when you’re batting away at a frenzy of bugs, so I try to keep it at an arm’s length away for safety. I have yet to target flies and mosquitos, but I have some confidence that it will work. Whether or not it will knock them out or put them out that is to be determined. The charging stand is so convenient if you’re sitting out and want to have on your table. Keep in mind if the noise, and let your neighbors know. You will have carnage caught in between the metal; I would use a brush to clean it off. I don’t remember or recall if it comes with one. Generally, I think this little racket is great and know it’s serving my journey in keeping the pests well away from me."

This solar bug zapper is replacing an electric bug zapper. It comes with a solar panel, cables, and a bug zapper. It charges via USB-C and took about 4 hours to charge when I received it. In my 5th picture, you can see dead flies attached. There a few options with this solar bug zapper, I run it at nighttime mode so it charges in the day and turns on at night. The modes change via a metal toggle switch. In the video I have included, I am shining a light at the solar panel so that turns on and off. I leave the panel out in a sunny area so it charges in the day while the bug zapper turns on around 6 pm, I still see it on around midnight so I'm not sure how long it lasts usually but it's at least 6 hours. Overall, I'm quite happy with this purchase and its performance."

I had a bit of a gnat infestation that I couldn’t get a handle on. I treated my drains, started making vinegar traps and putting them places, cleaned all my cabinets and stove and microwave, started taking the trash out more, and so many other things.I finally woke up one night, again, to one buzzing up my nose and I had it. I legitimately hate ordered this and two other products and waited for my revenge!The instant it got to my house I opened and installed…I’ve never been so relieved when it zapped it’s first bug. I kept wondering if it would work or do anything, and boy did it! If I had to have a complaint, it would be the startling POP/ZAP when a bug meets its end.It still scares me now after a few weeks, but no more gnats, no more bugs at all honestly.I recommend you put it somewhere flat to easily clean up the little graveyard that gets left behind. I literally just keep it on auto, plugged into its little dock in a corner, and let it do its thing.This has saved me so much stress and annoyance. All I can say is, take a chance on this thing. It’s been a month or so and no more gnats buzzing in my face. So happy."

This handy gadget has quickly become my go-to tool for getting rid of pesky fruit flies around the house.I spent a ton of money trying to get rid of fruit flies but nothing worked as well as this.First of all, the build quality of this fly swatter is excellent.

The swatter also comes with a built-in rechargeable battery, which is a huge plus as it saves money and the hassle of constantly buying new batteries.What I love about this electric fly swatter is its versatility. It's not just for fruit flies - it works equally well on mosquitoes, moths, and other small insects. The swatter is also very easy to use. You simply press the button to activate the electric grid and swipe at the insect.Another great feature of this electric swatter is its safety. The electric grid is covered with a protective layer, so you don't have to worry about accidentally touching it with your hand.Overall, I highly recommend this Electric Fly Swatter to anyone who is tired of dealing with pesky insects around the house.

These small, really tiny mosquitos are giving me welts like never before.  I bought this racket and it does the job so well.  Depending on the size of your house and how bad you have insects that come in, I’d suggest you buy at least two.  Our dog is old and walks in so slow allowing the mosquitos to sneak in quickly.  We have an outdoor zapper too, but this is perfect for the inside.  I keep it in the base the majority of the time unless I have to grab it to take to a room if I saw the darn flying blood sucker."

When I wake in the morning I see an excessive amount of dead flies and mosquitoes. Very great and more than I expected. Would recommend for anyone with a serious pest issue."

We have been plagued by flies and mosquitos. One of these flies has been enjoying its time terrorizing us in the house and laughing at our attempts to rid ourselves of it. That ended today! We tried the plug in light traps as well as home made ones to no avail. Within 15 seconds of opening this product, the fly was no more!!! The device came charged so that I was able to use it right out of the package and I am so grateful! It is so easy to use that I even plan an outdoor and in garage fly hunt today! For anyone plagued by flying insects, this is the end to it all!"

My legs were filled with bites at one point so I decided to invest into an electric fly squatter. What makes this fly swatter so impressive is the functionalities and build quality it possess. It is able to kill bugs overnight and is very light and portable which makes killing those pests like nothing. Compared to a traditonal fly swatter, it is so much more effortless and 100% worth the price tag. It also has a long battery life and feels very sturdy. This product will last me a couple more years in California and will for sure recommend to others."

We have glue sheets up everywhere and the lights with the glue paper too. Nothing else gets rid of the bugs as satisfactorily as this zapper! The zapper does kill the bugs and it’s so satisfying!

We have over 100 house plants and little gnats seem to like the dirt.  We tried everything to get rid of them and nothing worked.  This gets their attention with the light and them zaps them right on the spot with no action required from me.  I have a paper plate under mine and it has tons of dead gnats on it.  I LOVE, LOVE Love this thing!  Best part is no more gnats in my wine every evening.  We just went through fly season and the swatter works great as a hand held swatter too.  I can't recommend this swatter enough.  Get it!  You Won't Regret It!  It is a fantastic product."

I needed a quick solution for it and this is it!  The light attracts the bugs and then zap they're gone.  We've had a fruit fly problem and i just set this out at night and the next day you can see that tons of them were zapped.  I also can take this outside with me when I go outside to attract mosquitoes away from me while I hangout outside especially at night.  It works wonders.  If you need a zapper to get rid of the annoying bugs, this is a great solution.  I highly recommend this to everyone!"

This racket however attracts the bugs, so if I see one I grab the racket and turn it on an boom bug flies right to it!It definitely an upgrade from other rackets but it’s probably even better than a stationary blue light attracting unit because you can just bring the racket to the bug.Although the stationary set up works as well, at night I turn it on in area by plants or prone to collect bugs. It usually gets all of them!"

We bought this the day before the party and set it up for the evening of the party. That evening I didn’t hear any zaps and I was afraid it wasn’t working but somehow we were not getting bit by mosquitoes. The next morning I looked in the zapper and it had hundreds as mosquitoes in there. I guess their bodies are so tiny you don’t hear the zap but they definitely  attract mosquitoes and stop them. It was a party saver."

This is the best $ I've spent in a while!! Love this electric fly swatter. You can use it for flies fruit, gnats, house flys, mosquitoes etc. You can put it in slaughter mode and hold the big button on the back and electrocute them or you can put it on attraction mode and the black light comes on to draw bugs to it and you can set it in its charging base and allow it to work as a bug zapper. I find myself hunting gnats and flies that the dogs let in and hearing that zzzzaaaaaaapp and sizzle is so satisfying!! ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡My mom and I both have one and we love using it inside and outside! (Btw if you have dogs that spend any time outside slowly run this a few inches from their back end and you'll be surprised how many gnats go zzzzaaaaaaapp ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡!)"

At dusk, mosquitos swarm like no other. We have a blue light lantern that we plug when we are relaxing outside but also needed something more portable. This has been a great device so far... we use it when we are outside and have also used it inside when mosquitos get in. It has been a few days and have yet to have to charge. It instantly zaps the bugs if you swing and hit them. Highly recommend!"

It's well built, easy to use and to clean and seems to be very good quality all around.

Glad I finally found this product at the late summer. It actually comes with multiple options for how to operate. It is not just for solar but you can charge the battery directly with the cable. And I love its long connecting cable between the solar panel and the light. You can put the solar panel somewhere else with more sun exposure while you can put the light under the shades, where most of the bugs are hiding! Great design!"
