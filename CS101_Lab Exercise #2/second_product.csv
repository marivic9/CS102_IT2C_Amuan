"1","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,":City Slicker",NA,"4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I just wanted to know the temperature and humidity in my house. This device does a nice job of telling me what I want to know. It can stand on its own or its magnet will stick to your refrigerator. It also stores the minimum and maximum of temperature and humidity.  The one button changes from Celsius to Fahrenheit and also clear the history. Very easy to read with big digits (2 cm)."

Forgot it on my porch railing for a week or so..It got knocked off landed in the dirt and rained on...STILL GOING!!!

I have several thermometers and another hygrometer but THIS one is my favorite. Very easy to use with a clear easy to read layout. Durable, weatherproof, high quality, easy to use and read! GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT PRICE!!"
"3","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,":City Slicker",NA,"3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor ThermometerThis indoor thermometer and humidity gauge is a great option for monitoring the temperature and humidity in your home. Please note that it is for indoor use only and not suitable for a wet or outdoor environment.In a connected world, this device is without external connections, so it's not suitable for remote monitoring.Simple, easy to set up and use. Only one button -- to change from C (default) to F temperature.Strong magnet and built-in retractable stand.Although the display contrast is good, there is no backlighting, so hard or impossible to read in darkened rooms.  This would be the one improvement I can suggest -- a backlight, ideally with a corded powered option.Pros:Highly accurate: With a temperature accuracy of ±1°F and humidity accuracy of ±2-3% RH, it provides reliable readings.Quick refresh rate: The data is updated every 10 seconds, giving you the latest information about your environment.Wide measurement range: It can measure temperature from -58°F to 158°F (-50°C to 70°C) and humidity from 10% to 99%.High and low records: It displays the highest and lowest temperature and humidity levels recorded, allowing you to track changes over time.Face icon comfort indicator: This is a handy feature that provides a quick visual indication of whether the current humidity level is comfortable, dry, or wet.Easy to read: The large, clear display makes it easy to see the temperature and humidity readings.Portable and versatile: It comes with a tabletop stand and a magnetic back, so you can place it on a counter or fridge.Long battery life: It is powered by a single AAA battery, which can last for up to 18-24 months.Cons:No backlight: This could make it difficult to read the display in low-light conditions.No connectivity: It does not connect to a smartphone app, so you cannot monitor the temperature and humidity remotely.Comes with the single AAA battery already installed.Loses high and low records if battery is removed."
"4","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Kindle Customer",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I needed a measure for the humidity in my room bc i’m dealing with mold at the moment, and this is a super powerful thermometer! it takes accurate readings (I moved it from place to place and it changed within seconds) and I love that it has other features, like showing the high and the low in your room for the day. Fast readings, I trust the accuracy and i’ve only had it for a couple days. Will update if anything goes awry but I highly doubt it. Absolutely worth the $10"
"5","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Bassin",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Gives easy to read indoor humidity reading (which is why I purchased it)  as well as indoor temperature. It has a little popout stand so it can be placed anywhere, without taking up much space, and a magnet to put on fridge, etc.Too much humidity can contribute to mold growth, so this gadget helps me know when to turn on the dehumidifier."
"6","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Bassin",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Needed a small portable temperature gauge for my babies room/travel and this was does the trick. It has multiple settings on there besides temp, like humidity. It also has a magnetic strip on the back so you can either use that or the little kickstand to stand it up. I’ve had mine for a couple months now and it has worked perfectly ever since. It’s easy to read, bold dark numbers i can read from across the room. I know it reads correctly too because i have an air purifier in the same room that shows the temp too and it always reads the same. It’s durable and doesn’t feel cheap."
"7","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"meepbeep",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Temperature regulation is a common problem for people living in apartments. This has been essential for better quality sleep during the winter months. I live in an old apartment and have no control over my heat (forced air). I've since determined that my bedroom hovers at around 80 degrees and drops below 20% humidity.I can now regulate the temperature in my bedroom by opening a window periodically without running the risk of triggering the heat to turn on from the incoming cold air. It allows me to use my humidifier as needed to keep the humidity at a safe level (30% or above) without having to keep it on 24 hours per day.Seems accurate, great price point, highly recommend."
"8","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"meepbeep",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This ThermoPro TP50 was an inexpensive way for me to set the humidity temperature in my bedroom . At night , the air was much too dry; however, instead of having the humidifier on throughout the night, it would shut off by itself after the tempertaure reached my comfort-level setting . Then, it would only go  on by itelf if it went below that level . During the day I would not have it on, no sense of keeping it on and create a high electric bill. I start up the humidifier about 2 hours before I go to bed each night -- It helps me sleep -- and  when I get up in the morning I don't have any sinus issues.  Now I know the exact temperature that works best for me. Thank you ThermoPro TP50."
"9","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Beverly",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I use this product to gauge the humidity in my 3d printing room as well as within the chamber of printers to read the temperature. It seems accurate, however I do not have anything to compare it against. I'm not super confident about it's accuracy below 15% humidity as it seems like it's designed to be more around comfortable living rather then my niche of pushing humidity as low as I can.The temperature updates pretty quickly when moving inside and out of a printing enclosure, which helps me understand when I am safe to begin printing harder filaments."
"10","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Ashlee",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I purchased this to make sure the humidity in our house stays above 40% for my birds. I have now also started using it in the kitchen to track the air temperature while fermenting/proofing dough. I love that it is magnetic and you can easily stick it to different parts of the house to track temperature and humidity in different rooms. I really have no way to verify the humidity because I don’t have anything else to track that but it seems right. The temperature is on point with other thermometers I have. Overall I’m very satisfied with this product and would recommend."
"11","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,":City Slicker",NA,"4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We keep our travel trailer in storage at a family members house and I like to just have this inside so I can check the max temp and humidity the interior reaches while it’s sitting. Sometimes I throw it in the trailers fridge too just to see how cool it’s getting before we pack the fridge. Works great placed next to our aerogarden as well to keep an eye out for our plants."
"12","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Logan Weyland",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We first purchased these when we brought our son home from the hospital. As some of you may know, you are supposed to keep newborns between 68-72 degrees F. Setting your thermostat there is one thing, but really knowing the room you're in's temperature is a completely different thing. We have one of these in every room we spend time in, and we find that they're incredibly helpful in dialing in the temp we need.Also very helpful for plants or pets."
"13","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"AG",NA,"3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I love the low-high humidity readings. I 3D print and it’s important to know what the humidity is and really nice to know what it was and the range.I have a couple of the regular ones of these for my filament storage boxes. I really wish I had this model in all of them just to ease my mind."
"14","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Regular Guy",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","It's a bit smaller than a standard playing card but easy to read. It gives the high and low as well as current humidity and temp. I like it. The button on the back easily switches it between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Nicely priced. I already recommended it to a friend who was concerned about his AC and the humidity control."
"15","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Cold and Wet in the NW",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I kept this on my nightstand to be sure my baby was warm enough in his bassinet.As an exclusive pumper this also helped me to be sure my milk wouldn’t go bad if it was sitting out for a few hours.I love it- I want to get one for every room in the house haha"
"16","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Amazon Customer",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I had one from a different company already but wanted a couple more. I added a furnace humidifier this last winter and wanted to monitor temp/humidity in multiple locations. they have magnets and stands so you can just stick them to something metal or a refrigerator or just use the kick stand."
"17","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Natalie Marte",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I really like this! I purchased it for my bedroom because during these winter months it becomes dry. I’m able to see the humidity level to determine if I should use my humidifier to make the air comfortable. The nice feature is seeing the temperature. The setup is nice. The screen is clear & precise. I like how it stands upon its own, there’s also a magnetic backing. AAA batteries last awhile. This is a quality product I’m happy I invested in. It’s well worth the cost. I purchased one for my Dad as well. I do recommend!"
"18","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"B. Schultz",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I now have six ThermoPro thermometers in, around, and outside my house. They let me know exactly what the temperature and humidity are in each one, and I can know what the real conditions are outside instead of relying on the weather service--without having to go outside. I would recommend these products."
"19","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"B. Schultz",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I run a humidifier that doesn’t have a humidity sensor so I decided to purchase this to know when to turn the humidifier on or off. It works great. The stand is very sturdy and the magnet on the back of it is also very nice to have.My favorite feature is the history tracking for both humidity and temperature."
"20","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"mesh",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I had two of these for an apartment I had in Oregon because I was having issues with mold growing in my apartment.I kept it and brought it to my condo here in WA.  It has helped me control the climate in my homes as well as be able to determine how off my thermostat is.Love them so much I bought one for my desk at work because I was burning up and needed to know the temperature so I could dress accordingly.Highly recommend!"
"21","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,":City Slicker",NA,"4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I got this two pack to better understand why my home felt so uncomfortable.The upstairs felt humid. I knew I needed to insulate and I had a plan. I tested bothSide by side and one was off by a degree. I moved them to two other spots with the same results. It was good enough for me. I installed one upstairs and one on the 1sr floor. Both were installed on walls with a metal plate. If you touch them the readings will increase so plan where to put them.The upstairs was much more humid than downstairs. Of course the humidity increased when it rained. I installed a dehumidifier upstairs. I could check numbers on all three devices. The upstairs went from 94% to 54% and felt amazing. After a few months of wild readings and much reaseach, I realized I needed to encapsulate my crawl space! My house is 73 years old and in need of key upgrades. These little guys are allowing me to track the moisture thru all stages of the home upgrades so I know if what I am doing is making things better or worse!! I am very glad I got these in the fall.These are well worth the money!"

Easy to use; works as it is supposed to."
"34","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Phodia",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I bought this specifically to use when I was making a wild yeast sourdough starter and now use it when during the bread proofing stages. It gives an average room temperature and well as information of the moment.My only gripe is that it doesn't have a square bottom like the other five Thermopro room thermometers I have all over the house and instead depends on a stand for it to sit at an angle. The others sit evenly on the wired furnace/ac thermostats."

"37","ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Monitor with Temperature Humidity Gauge",NA,"Titanboas",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Product works as described! Very accurate! Temperature is spot on when I test it against my digital thermostat. I have no real way of testing the humidity level but I believe it’s accurate. I use this in my small RV camper! Take a reading in the morning, after not venting out the trailer at night. But as as I air out the RV, the humidity levels starts dropping slowly as the camper is now allowed to breath easier. Would definitely recommend! The plastic leg works great for just sitting it on a counter or table."
