"1","Govee WiFi Thermometer Hygrometer",NA,"Ltk",NA,"4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I use this in my cigar humidor and it is perfect for the job. The option is there to calibre the unit via the app to make it provide perfect percentagee for both humidity and temperature.Highly recommend."
"2","Govee WiFi Thermometer Hygrometer",NA,"SG",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Great that it tracks data and 100x more responsive than the bluetooth only version. Can get updates when I'm away from home although it sometimes takes a minute or 2."
"3","Govee WiFi Thermometer Hygrometer",NA,"The Great Cambino",NA,"3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Very detailed and accurate."
"4","Govee WiFi Thermometer Hygrometer",NA,"T. M.",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We use multiple of these across several sites and being able to see accurate data in real time is a game changer. Setup was super easy and being able to name each device makes it very easy manage several units at a time.The battery will around a year before needing replacement."
"5","Govee WiFi Thermometer Hygrometer",NA,"Marian Koczocik",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This is such a great little mine of information. I love the App which has loads of historical data. I’m going to buy a second one now for inside the house."
"6","Govee WiFi Thermometer Hygrometer",NA,"Marshall",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Cutest little contraption! I dont leave it outside all the time. Its really for spot checks on the general outdoor conditions. Its hung on my plant stand (you might be able to spy it there)I got it for my plants wintering outside and to also check temp and humidity for them indoors. I just moved to central Queensland, Australia 4680 and as the majority of my plants are tropical they need around 50% upwards of humidity to flourish plus temps above 12 degrees celcius. I am hoping they toughen up and acclimate (fingers crossed) if not then at least I can see the conditions if they deteriorate and try to compensate (a greenhouse?)Now I can make adjustments if I need to, quite pleased with this! It works with the app on your phone."
