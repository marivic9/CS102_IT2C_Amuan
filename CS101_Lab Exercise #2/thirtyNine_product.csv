"2","Miracle-Gro Plant Food Fertiliser, 500G",NA,"pjturner2008","Reviewed in Australia on 1 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I have always sprayed my azaleas rhododendrons and camelias with a soluble fertilizer, but Miracle Gro seems to have a better NPK ratio, and the plants are flowering better this year than before"

"5","Miracle-Gro Plant Food Fertiliser, 500G",NA,"stacey d.","Reviewed in Australia on 28 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This is an amazing product which produces more flowers, greener leaves and is so simple to use. I am not a gardener but I would not be without this product in my garden shed as it gives amazing results time after time."
"6","Miracle-Gro Plant Food Fertiliser, 500G",NA,"Wendy Booker","Reviewed in Australia on 1 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I used it this past spring and can confidently say that it made my plants look bigger and livelier than before. Yes it doesn't look like the most natural fertiliser and it won't improve your overall soil quality but it definitely delivers the nutrients and food that plants need. It's so simple I usually just mix two spoons to a 9L watering can and just give the plants a good feed every 2 or so weeks. It's definitely a quick solution for plants that aren't looking that great or just need a quick boost. I won't solely rely on this as I believe plants do need some compost or organic matter to improve overall soil quality as well but this is great when I don't have much time to garden."

I've had to prune more often andvI have so many more lemons on my potted plants, I'm giving them to friends. I've been using this product for 20+ years and still use the original sprayer. Didn't use for last 5 years, it wasn't available in my area, until I saw it on Amazon, and I order heaps at a time."
