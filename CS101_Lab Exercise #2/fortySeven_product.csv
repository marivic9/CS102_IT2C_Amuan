"2","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"Phreddie","Reviewed in Australia on 12 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I bought this compact washer because I was so sick of lugging my other washer up and down my stairs.  It is compact, only 5 kilos, easy to assemble and does the job.  Couldn't be happier!"
"3","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"All About Gadgets","Reviewed in Australia on 9 September 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Powerful enough for small jobs. I had a small but very dirty stone patio which had caked on dirt and hadn’t been washed for two years.  This machine blasted the dirt off. I could have bought a much more powerful machine but an unheard of brand, however, this machine is good enough for the small area I had."
"4","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"JB","Reviewed in Australia on 30 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","What I like: Small, portable, easy to set up and pack upWhat I dislike: That I had to buy the extension hose but it is a must-have if you get this.I've used this to wash the car, clean the pavements in the back yard and around the pool. So easy to use and set up. Also came with a Karcher adapter for accessories if you already have some or are thinking of getting a Karcher because of the available accessories.Like I have mentioned above. I highly recommend that you get the extension hose. Otherwise, you would be moving the machine around way too often. I washed the car and not once had to reposition the pressure washer due to having a short hose."
"5","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"Paul W.","Reviewed in Australia on 6 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Light enough to carry around.  Small enough to not take up too much storage space.  Very effective water pressure.  Main use will be to clean our unit balcony which does not have a readily available water source.  We like the fact that this cleaner is self-priming and can suck water from a bucket as well as connect to a hose outlet."

"7","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"DavidC","Reviewed in Australia on 13 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Really love this pressure washer - simple to set up (you will need your own garden hose) and cleaned my balcony area perfectly in a short time."
"8","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"EDDIE FORREST","Reviewed in Australia on 4 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Bought this as a portable unit as I already have a large petrol pressure washer. For giving the car a quick clean, this is perfect ratger than bringing out the big one. I also purchased the 6m extension hose and I can go around the whole car without moving the unit. More than enough power for those quick jobs and also easy to get ready and pack up. It even fits in the boot of my convertible.Bought this to go with the Bosch EasyAquatak 120 and it's perfect. As the pressure washer doesn't have wheels as I bought it for portability, this extension allows me to chasm the car without moving the pressure washer unit."
"9","Bosch Home & Garden Home & Garden 1500 Watt Electric High Pressure Washer Cleaner",NA,"Ms","Reviewed in Australia on 21 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Perfect for the home user.
