"1","Debco Premium Potting Mix 10L",NA,"SusanT",NA,"4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I needed a smaller bag to top up some outdoor plants. This is a 10L bag and so half the size of the normal ones. Will probably fill a 2-3 pot plants of regular size. Convenient to order these via Amazon due to quick delivery. Also not having to lug a bag home from the shops. Good mix inside the bag. This was value for money"

"10","Debco Premium Potting Mix 10L",NA,"Radar",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I used this potting mix to up-size some of my patio plants and am very happy with the mix. No pieces of bark or sticks as in other potting mixes I have tried, just a dark, sweet smelling medium to plant into. I hope my plants are as pleased with it as I am! I shall use this again when I need more. I just pity the poor delivery driver staggering up the steps with2 bags of it, but he seemed to take it in his stride."

"45","Debco Premium Potting Mix 10L",NA,"Tejal soneji",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I received months ago and still using.  I have no complain to make, probably I would have been lucky.  No gnats so far even in my remaining mix.  I am not an gardening expert.  I have used many other so called premium mixes from Bunnings Australia.  Even though none had flies / gnats, came in different sized materials and soft organic elements.  This too is similar.  My concern and weakness is over watering.  But managed to keep plants healthy.  This did not give any special growth to my plants, therefore I had to feed the potting mix with small amount nutrients.  Yes I had bought some cheap mixes that had flies/gnats, which lead to quick infestation of gnats."
