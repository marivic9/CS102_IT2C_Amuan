"1","AISITIN Solar Fountain","Works great when the sun shines!","lucky quinto","Reviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023","3.9 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I used this to make a small birdbath for songbirds and hummingbirds.  Surprisingly powerful when in full sun!  Have had it 2 years and it still works well.  It does not have a battery to store up the solar power, so when the sun isn't shining it doesn't work."
"2","AISITIN Solar Fountain","Werkt goed","Tim C.","Reviewed in Australia on 17 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Voor de mini vijver, bij veel zon gaat de sproeier erg hoog en loopt de vijver leeg. Dus goed kijken waar je de zonnepaneel neer zet."
"3","AISITIN Solar Fountain","Great Value","Ingrid","Reviewed in Canada on 5 February 2024","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Years ago I bought a solar cascade water fountain, The solar panel and pump were in two separate sections and stopped working due to a fault with the connecting part. To get a replacement from the company that manufactured it would have cost approx £40, so not worth it as that wasn't far off the cost of the whole item. I was really pleased to find the Aisitin solar fountain pump and panel especially as the kit included a length of clear tubing which I needed to feed the water from the pump to the top of my water feature. Also there is no connecting part - it is wired straight from the panel to the pump so nothing to go wrong there. Works really well even if not bright sunshine so very pleased. Had to secure tube with peg to pump as seemed to be a bit loose but otherwise is fine. Great value!"

"6","AISITIN Solar Fountain","Great little pump for strictly direct sun use","BMG","Reviewed in Germany on 14 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Purchased this pump to make a DIY hummingbird fountain. Pump works instantly when sunlight hits the solar panel. However, it must be in full, direct sunlight. I tried to install it in sunlight that is filtering through a large Crepe Myrtle tree, it will not work. Just make sure there is absolutely nothing between the sun and the solar panel, and it's an awesome little pump. This is not a solar panel that charges up with sunlight. It will only work during direct sunlight hours, as there is no battery being charged by the sun. Great pump for daytime use. Suction cups on bottom to hold pump in place, and includes clear tubing to pump the water further away if you want to hide the pump, and not place nozzles directly on top of the pump."
