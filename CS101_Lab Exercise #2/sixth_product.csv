"1","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Catherine F.",NA,"4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This bug zapper was ready to go right out of the box.  It comes with a chain, so that you can easily hang it anywhere.  The chain comes packaged in it's own little bag, but is very quick and easy to attach - it just clips right onto to the sides.  After that you attach the charging cord provided (or any micro USB cord), plug in and turn on! My only complaint, is that I wish it was a USB C cord instead for charging.  Other than that it's simple to use, works well, and is very lightweight."
"2","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"La pola",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I had a bad problem with yellow jackets. Tried many solutions but none worked. I was looking for a flat panel zapper because the round or square ones won't work for me. The yellow jackets were in the roof where the front wall meets near our front door. Mounted the zapper against the wall on one end and against the roof on the other. A little creative blocking with soft packing foam and duck tape and it was good to go. This thing was amazing. In two days my problem was pretty much solved. Will leave it up for the next week or so. The eggs in the nest will hatch and the problem will start again so gonna get the rest in a few days. Did not have the mounting very good and the zapper fell about six feet and bounced off the concrete. It still works. Nothing broke. Just a warning to anyone trying this. Yellow jackets are very tough. Although many were instantly killed, many fell to the ground and remained alive for quite some time. They weren't moving much but I wouldn't want pets or anyone near them until they died. Overall, this bug zapper was great. Left it on at night and fried a ton of mosquitoes. Good purchase."
"3","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Catherine F.",NA,"1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Brought this in the urgent need of getting rid of mosquito and flies especially now summer is here. My backyard now got chickens and they poop everywhere and its a not a fun picture where flies and all sorts of pests gather. This zapper killer worked well and kill plenty. I do hope it does not zap the chicken if it gets too close, where they flap their wings to reached the walls XD. It's really easy to install and easy to clean where i just shake a little, and all the dead flies comes off, noise wise is okay since Im placing outside."

"6","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"jackie",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I was worried if the LED lamp would perform as well as the traditional fluorescent lamps.  After a week I can confirm that it does attract bugs.  My work area doesnâ€™t have a lot of bugs that Iâ€™m aware of, but judging from the amount of bugs on the catch gray, it looks like there were more bugs than I thought.Although flies donâ€™t seem to be that attracted to UV light.  Iâ€™ve only seen one fly getting trapped."
"7","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Ciara",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I love the smell of mosquitoes getting fried in the morning! Love bugs but when it comes to mosquitoes , lantern flys and stink bugs in the house I kill â€˜em all. Iâ€™d torture them if I could. World trade is slowly going to destroy ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ it even makes a cool inside night light so you donâ€™t have to turn on the bright white light that attracts bugs to your house."
"8","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Lisa",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This has quite a large killing area over the cylindrical style ones that we've had before. The design makes it very easy to clean and the high voltage bars are not so easy to deform as in the cylinder design. They are much more rigid and look to last a lot longer. The 'black light' tubes do seem to lure the insects and our back porch is much nicer to sit in at dusk and sunset than before we got them. We're pleased with this product."
"9","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Lisa",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Only thing bad about it is sometimes bugs get stuck and zaps constantly, but that would happen on most other ones. Kills the moths and beetles that fly around my back porch"

"11","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Catherine F.",NA,"4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Working with it both on camping, but also on a daily basis for the last two months, it is a very good product. Sure, not the most brightest one, but bright enough to attract all the surrounding flies and mosquitoes."
"12","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"La pola",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Iâ€™ve several of these devices located around the house. Two on the patio area, one in the garage and one in the laundry room. We leave them on 24/7. Hearing the execution of bugs means another pest has bitten the dust. I suggest buying several to hear the symphony pops and cracks. Die bug die."

"30","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"vinny chance",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"FINALLY, I have found an effective method for dealing with stink bugs!Just look at the pic. That's two week's worth of dead stink bugs and lady bugs.Those pests have avoided glue traps, fly strips, etc. I'm not keen on spraying chemicals around the house to deal with lady bugs, and I've not found any chemical that works on stink bugs anyway.  I live practically in a forest in the southeastern US, so there's always going to be bugs to deal with.I've had this PALONE Electric Bug Zapper hanging in the house for 8 months and it's kept flying pests to an unprecedented minimum. Before I got this, the only method I had for stink bugs that did not involve smashing them (and thereby stinking up the house AND attracting move stink bugs) was to catch them in empty soda or water bottles. So tedious.I wish I had gotten this PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3 years earlier when the stinkbug problem started in this area. I'm about to buy another one right now for a family member's house.The removable tray is a simple, but fantastic feature. 99% of the bugs fall right into it. The remaining 1% get stuck to the grid and I use a wooden chopstick to knock them off, into the tray.The light is BRIGHT, like sleep disturbingly bright. I have the PALONE Electric Bug Zapper hung in the hallway and I have to close my bedroom door at night or I can't get to sleep with that brightness."
"31","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Catherine F.",NA,"4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Light weight, easy to use anywhere can be set done or hung."
"32","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"La pola",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Speaks for itself. Just hang it and no more bugs. Finally"
"33","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Daizy",NA,"1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","It works well. There is a removable tray where the insect bodies gather. You can clean it very easily. The violet light is also not that sharp to the eyes and could be kept at a corner in your drawing room."
"34","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Stacy Lynn",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Wow! I was amazed by this product. I was looking for a specific design and wanted it to be a rectangular slip shape so that it would fit behind the patio chairs and between cabinets. Itâ€™s lightweight and easy to use. I noticed a huge difference in the amount of bugs after turning it on. I tested out another brand as well and can conclude this one is my best performing one"

"38","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Eden Siq",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We've had a recent uptick in mosquitoes due to the building of a new retention pond in the connecting neighborhood. This was a timely purchase as we'll be spending more evenings outside and would prefer not to get bit up! My only downside is that since it has to be plugged in, it would be great to have a long cord, but we'll just connect it to an extension cord."
"39","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Lisa",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Itâ€™s working so good. Summer will be comfortable."

"41","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Catherine F.",NA,"4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I really like this product! I used to have a lot of bugs and insects at night coming inside my house, and this has really amazed me. Is very effective. If you have kids, keep it away from them.

"45","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Artur",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This mosquito zapper works as I expected. Itâ€™s a perfect size for our back yard. Iâ€™ve put on our table for now but we are installing a pergola and will hang this under. It come with the chain and you can easily latch the chain to the zapper. Iâ€™ve had other zappers that work with a battery and they are too much to maintain and they have low power. This one I just connected it with a USB plug and turn it on. You donâ€™t have to worry about charging it or itâ€™s battery life."
"46","PALONE Electric Bug Zapper 3200V Mosquito Zapper ",NA,"Artur",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I'm thrilled with my new electric bug zapper!
