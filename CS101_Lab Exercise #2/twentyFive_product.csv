"1","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Hernan","Reviewed in Australia on 13 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Long hoses are such a pain; the 22.5m version of this hose is a joy in comparison to a standard hose. No kinks, no tangles. Only drawback is I have to attach the pressure washer when it is at its short length, then attach hose & turn water on so the hose will “grow” & then I carry it all to where I need to be. Well worth it for the headaches this hose has solved."
"2","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"The Murrays","Reviewed in Australia on 2 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Once assembled and turned on, the hose began to quickly grow in size as if it were alive. When turning the hose off, it shrank again to it's original size, making it quicker and easy to put away. The material feels soft and flexible. The gun that came with it feels high in quality, with no leaks and multiple spray options. I found the shower option a bit too powerful for my plants, so I swapped it for my old gun. The overall look and feel of the hose is both stylish and functional."
"3","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Louise A","Reviewed in Australia on 17 August 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Fast delivery, am really pleased with the quality of the hose and fittings.  Would recommend"
"4","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Belle","Reviewed in Australia on 12 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Used now for 6 weeks. So far so good. Lightweight and easy to store. Feels delicate so have been extra careful. The attachments feel quality."
"5","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Mrs. J. Smith","Reviewed in Australia on 19 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","A great hose and as advertised, it doesn’t coil up and it comes with the wall bracket to hang the hose up when not in use."
"6","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Amazon Customer","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","When you try it off it needs to be drained, that's what the instructions say. It takes about 10 to 15 seconds to drain holding the lever on the sprayer. The other option, if your in a hurry,  is to take the sprayer off but be careful water spurts out just as if you still had it turned on. Other than that its great, no heavy plastic to carry and being 65 that's a winner in itself. Once my neighbours, 65 to 76, saw it they wanted one to. I also got one for my son and son in law."
"7","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Gregory Hynds","Reviewed in Australia on 13 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This is one of those rare gadgets you find on Amazon that's actually amazing. It really does get 3 times as big when it fills up and then shrinks when you release the water. This is more convenient than you'd think and makes me wonder, why are we not using this everywhere? The fittings are high quality and the black and brass looks great. It's day 1 for me, not sure if it's durable but it's very good out of the box. If this thing lasts more than a year, then it's great value."

"9","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Anthony","Reviewed in Australia on 17 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This hose was a replacement for a cheaper but similar quality. This product does all it claims in terms of it being kink-free and with good sturdy connections. We are very happy with the quality and functionality of the hose.The shipping if this product was exceptionally fast!! Ordered December 23rd with a delivery date of Jan 6th but arrived within 24 hours, on Christmas Eve!! Outstanding service and hubby is extremely happy with the hose."
"10","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Sam1122","Reviewed in Australia on 1 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Excellent delivery time. Took a few mins to work out fitting. But very happy so far no leaking. Longevity the only question I have at this stage.  But price was good. Just hope it lasts long enough to not add to the planet’s rubbish problem.UPDATEStill going strong. Very happy with this hose. Fittings have stiffened up a bit but no leakage. It’s been left outdoors in elements for more than 18 months so very satisfied. I was thinking of getting another longer one but seems to have increased significantly."
