"1","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Easy to Use and Work Great For Price!","Linda Gordon","Reviewed in Australia on 24 January 2024","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I was skeptical as there are always people who give bad reviews. But I was also desperate. I live in the country so occasional mice are an issue but this seems to be an infestation larger than normal. Poison wasn't working - probably poisoning one mouse but not the batch. I liked the look of these for easy set up and because they were re-usable. The traps came this afternoon. I only set up 2 of the 6 from the pack. Super easy. Within one hour of setting it up (while I was sitting in the same room!) the trap went off and I had my first mouse. Disposed of it in 2 seconds and took another 2 seconds to re-set the same trap. I didn't even need to rebait it. Within another hour and a half (still sitting in same room) I had my second mouse (same trap). These do the job and even if they do konk out after a few uses it will be worth the money as they are cheap for the price.  One note - I used a VERY tiny amount of peanut butter (like half a  pinky nail in size and put it down deep in the bait bowl. Don't pile it up or use a lot as it gives the mouse the ability to possibly eat and retreat without setting anything off. By putting it down in the cup he has to reach his head in there for it. Likewise, don't avoid the cup and put it back further in the trap....the bait bowl seems designed to make sure their neck is in line when it closes. If you put the bait too far back in the trap you may not catch its neck so use as directed, I will definitely buy these again if I need them!!!!Update - still working great. Still using same 2 traps. 4 mice caught so far by these traps (3 in one trap, 1 in another) and I haven't had to re-bait either trap yet. I don't know why I wasn't using these all along so much faster and more effective than poison!Update 4/16 - 1 year later and still going GREAT!  I have still only used 2 traps out of the entire pack. The springs are still working fantastic and they are just as lethal as when I bought them a year ago so WELL worth the price!!!  They continue to work after more than a year, and I still have spares if/when I need them. There is no blood or mess so the traps don't get gross. This is a clean kill to the skull or neck. I just toss the dead mice out and reset - and occasionally refill the little bait cup with fresh peanut butter. If these are not working for you then you are not setting them in the right place. I have two different types of mice getting in because I'm in the country. Normal ""house"" mice and lighter brown field mice. These traps have long since exterminated the regular house mice so they worked to get rid of this type 100%....but then I started getting field mice. I think they found a way into my sunroom from the outside wall. At any rate. At first, the traps would not catch them, and were even going off at times w/o catching anything. The trap would be snapped closed - but no mouse. I quickly realized these new mice were coming and going in a different part of the room. The place I had set the traps that worked on the house mice was not ideal anymore because the paths they were moving along were different. So I moved the traps to where I saw and heard the activity. Now these same two traps are catching field mice like gangbusters. I went from catching 2 mice a day to every other day to now only once every 1-2 weeks so I am sure I'm getting this infestation under control as well.  If you know you have mice but are not catching anything try these tips:  1. Put the trap against something like a box or a baseboard so that it is parallel to that object. Do not set them out in the open. Mice like to keep to the walls for safety and feel exposed if they are in the open. The traps that do best for me are always the ones where the trap is set right against a vertical surface like a wall or a box so that the mice encounter it while running along their ""safe"" paths.  2. If the traps keep going off but you are not catching anything there are two possibilities. One - you have rats not mice and the traps are too small. Two - they are not getting far enough into the trap and are able to jump free when it triggers. One solution to try is to only put a tiny bit of peanut butter way down inside the bait cup rather than over-filling the cup with a huge hunk of peanut butter. Using less makes them have to reach further in to get the bait. Less is more. Also...remember to refresh the peanut butter occasionally. It gets dry and crumbly and fresh stuff works best. My mice don't last long enough to eat the bait so I eventually have to clean out the crusty peanut butter and put in new stuff. Then the traps start catching mice again.  3. TIP: Remove all sources of food from the area or put it in plastic bins. I figured out what caused my two infestations. I had a bag of granola bars that had fallen behind something and was attracting them. Even if food is in a bag like pretzels etc...they can still smell it and will keep coming back."
"2","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Holy cow, INSTANT results!","Michael","Reviewed in Australia on 28 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I happened to see a mouse in my apartment on Sunday, ordered these the same day.  They arrived on Tuesday, I set them up, and on Wednesday morning I had TWO dead mice in my kitchen...  Holy cow, talk about effective!I've bought mousetraps like this before, but that one was (a) more expensive, and (b) a lot heavier-duty.  Taking them out of the package, they seemed to be made of plastic and a lot lighter duty than the old metal ones I bought and have since lost.  I thought for a moment that they wouldn't even be able to kill a mouse!BOY WAS I WRONG.A six-pack for this price is FANTASTIC.  What a deal!  The traps clearly work — no muss, no fuss, no mousey guts to clean up — and they have some nice features to them too.Reading other reviews, I did exactly as others did.  I took out the little bait compartments — how handy is not having to put your fingers INSIDE the trap to load it up? — put in a little bit of peanut butter — the little barrel takes very little, something I was ALSO worried about for NO GOOD REASON — and added a piece of cereal (Tim Horton's Apple Fritter to be specific).  I had to break the pieces into quarters to get them to fit, but that's another point in the product's favour, if you ask me: you don't have to use very much bait at all...Squeeze the back to prime the trap and put it on the floor facing the wall or a junction between counter and major appliance (oven and fridge in this case) and away you go.  Set it and forget it.  I woke up to TWO dead mice in the morning when I thought there'd only be one!  One of the traps had flipped over so I was staring at Mickey's belly while Minnie was showing me her back, but they were dead as doornails.Hold the trap over a garbage bag, squeeze the back, and out fall the mice.  RIP little guys (or gals).  I thought about adding photos of the late rodents to the collection of other images other reviewers have posted, but I wanted those little squeakers GONE so I didn't bother.  Into the trash they went.The traps are currently reset and once again in the kitchen — and with six of them, I've got more than enough if a whole gang decides to drop in — and while I hope I don't see another mouse, I'm fully confident that these traps will take care of 'em.The choice couldn't be simpler: buy these traps if you need to kill some mice.  You won't regret it.  Just remember that peanut butter helps hold the solid bait in place so the poor mouse HAS to really get in there to get their last meal, and the smell probably invites them in."
"3","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Great unit for household","BKW","Reviewed in the United States on 12 March 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Bought couple of model in the past but this one is the best ever. Very easy to load the food in the cup and ultra easy to arm the unit. I am up to 15 catchs after only 2 month, 1 trap in the house and 1 in the shed so they are catched outside before they get the idea to get in the house at fall. You want to get rid of the annoying beast, go for this model. The price for the qty of traps you get is excellent. I gave a couple to friends since I don't need that much who came in the box. Excellent bought, highly recommend."
"4","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Works very well","PMC","Reviewed in Canada on 16 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I had some concerns about this trap and why I’m giving 5 stars:1. Reliably - it has caught mice without fail when the trap goes off.2. Durability - it’s a hard plastic so I thought it couldn’t last. 1 trap has caught 7 mice and still sets just fine. I expect these to last many years inside my garage.3. Humanely kill - last night I hear a trap go off. The seconds it took check it, mice was dead.4. Function - very easy to bait and set. My main traps (and highest kill count) on each side of the garage door don’t need to be baited with how well these go off.5. Sanitation - as noted above, these have been instant kills. Mice don’t suffer and defecate all over the place (like glue traps). Another plus is the animal doesn’t get punctured nor squished (snap traps). At 10+ kills the past month, I’ve yet need to clean anything besides discarding the mouse."
"5","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Very effective solution to Rodent Problem! Thanks! ;-P","Niray","Reviewed in Canada on 18 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","These traps are effective and easy to use. We are being inundated with constant RAIN lately (suspect some geoengineering is responsible), and it is driving mice into our living quarters. UGH! So far with these ingenious little traps, I have caught FOUR invasive varmints and I just ordered another half-dozen of the traps, in case more of these unwanted guests appear! I also bought one of the electronic-zapper traps and it worked right away, but I decided I'd rather get lots of these small, inexpensive traps and just discard trap and rodent carcass in one fell swoop. So I only used the battery-operated zapper once; and I've used these small plastic traps several times. I like how easy it is to bait them and then ""cock"" them so they are all set to go when the hungry mouse sticks its head into the trap! On other (wooden) traps in the past I have come close to damaging my fingers on their spring-loaded devices, so I find these traps much safer and easier to use. I will continue to use these efficient, inexpensive traps should the need arise, but I really hope the rains will stop and the mouse invasions will soon be a distant, unpleasant memory! Many thanks for the ones who invented these clever little devices."
"6","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","They Work Great & Are Reusable","Max Som","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","The first time I put one of these out, I came back to find the peanut butter gone and the trap unsprung. I immediately cursed them and was going to toss them, but I decided to give them another try. This time I put less peanut butter so that it is further down into the cup and I moved them back from the wall a little. Many other traps say to put them along the wall because that's where they travel, but that causes them to approach the trap from the sides. Moving them back from the wall means the mice will circle and come in from the front.I immediately caught 2 mice.And the good things about these traps is that all you have to do is pick it up then drop the mouse into the bin and you're good to reuse.Now to get in touch with the company that ""mouse-proofed"" my house."
"7","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","A better mousetrap","MonetLover","Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've used these on and off for years when and where mice were a problem. I first found them as a Dollar Store item, and the pricing of these is actually less than their price a decade and a half ago.These work better than sticky baits, which deal a pretty horrible death leaving the victims to suffer. Poison baits lead to an agonizing death, and leave their bodies to rot where you cannot reach them. They're a definite step up from traditional wooden traps. I bait them with peanut butter. They do kill...if you're prepared to accept that, these work. They aren't messy, they kill instantly, and you also don't have to handle the victims. Use them in areas in the routes where you see their leavings. They're as good a solution as you can get for something unpleasant."

They continue to work after more than a year, and I still have spares if/when I need them. There is no blood or mess so the traps don't get gross. This is a clean kill to the skull or neck. I just toss the dead mice out and reset - and occasionally refill the little bait cup with fresh peanut butter. If these are not working for you then you are not setting them in the right place. I have two different types of mice getting in because I'm in the country. Normal ""house"" mice and lighter brown field mice. These traps have long since exterminated the regular house mice so they worked to get rid of this type 100%....but then I started getting field mice. I think they found a way into my sunroom from the outside wall. At any rate. At first, the traps would not catch them, and were even going off at times w/o catching anything. The trap would be snapped closed - but no mouse. I quickly realized these new mice were coming and going in a different part of the room. The place I had set the traps that worked on the house mice was not ideal anymore because the paths they were moving along were different. So I moved the traps to where I saw and heard the activity. Now these same two traps are catching field mice like gangbusters. I went from catching 2 mice a day to every other day to now only once every 1-2 weeks so I am sure I'm getting this infestation under control as well.  If you know you have mice but are not catching anything try these tips:  1. Put the trap against something like a box or a baseboard so that it is parallel to that object. Do not set them out in the open. Mice like to keep to the walls for safety and feel exposed if they are in the open. The traps that do best for me are always the ones where the trap is set right against a vertical surface like a wall or a box so that the mice encounter it while running along their ""safe"" paths.  2. If the traps keep going off but you are not catching anything there are two possibilities. One - you have rats not mice and the traps are too small. Two - they are not getting far enough into the trap and are able to jump free when it triggers. One solution to try is to only put a tiny bit of peanut butter way down inside the bait cup rather than over-filling the cup with a huge hunk of peanut butter. Using less makes them have to reach further in to get the bait. Less is more. Also...remember to refresh the peanut butter occasionally. It gets dry and crumbly and fresh stuff works best. My mice don't last long enough to eat the bait so I eventually have to clean out the crusty peanut butter and put in new stuff. Then the traps start catching mice again.  3. TIP: Remove all sources of food from the area or put it in plastic bins. I figured out what caused my two infestations. I had a bag of granola bars that had fallen behind something and was attracting them. Even if food is in a bag like pretzels etc...they can still smell it and will keep coming back."

I took out the little bait compartments — how handy is not having to put your fingers INSIDE the trap to load it up? — put in a little bit of peanut butter — the little barrel takes very little, something I was ALSO worried about for NO GOOD REASON — and added a piece of cereal (Tim Horton's Apple Fritter to be specific).  I had to break the pieces into quarters to get them to fit, but that's another point in the product's favour, if you ask me: you don't have to use very much bait at all...Squeeze the back to prime the trap and put it on the floor facing the wall or a junction between counter and major appliance (oven and fridge in this case) and away you go.  Set it and forget it.  I woke up to TWO dead mice in the morning when I thought there'd only be one!  One of the traps had flipped over so I was staring at Mickey's belly while Minnie was showing me her back, but they were dead as doornails.Hold the trap over a garbage bag, squeeze the back, and out fall the mice.

You won't regret it.  Just remember that peanut butter helps hold the solid bait in place so the poor mouse HAS to really get in there to get their last meal, and the smell probably invites them in."

Reliably - it has caught mice without fail when the trap goes off.2. Durability - it’s a hard plastic so I thought it couldn’t last. 1 trap has caught 7 mice and still sets just fine. I expect these to last many years inside my garage.3. Humanely kill - last night I hear a trap go off. The seconds it took check it, mice was dead.4. Function - very easy to bait and set. My main traps (and highest kill count) on each side of the garage door don’t need to be baited with how well these go off.5. Sanitation - as noted above, these have been instant kills. Mice don’t suffer and defecate all over the place (like glue traps). Another plus is the animal doesn’t get punctured nor squished (snap traps). At 10+ kills the past month, I’ve yet need to clean anything besides discarding the mouse."

One solution to try is to only put a tiny bit of peanut butter way down inside the bait cup rather than over-filling the cup with a huge hunk of peanut butter. Using less makes them have to reach further in to get the bait. Less is more. Also...remember to refresh the peanut butter occasionally. It gets dry and crumbly and fresh stuff works best. My mice don't last long enough to eat the bait so I eventually have to clean out the crusty peanut butter and put in new stuff. Then the traps start catching mice again.  3. TIP: Remove all sources of food from the area or put it in plastic bins. I figured out what caused my two infestations. I had a bag of granola bars that had fallen behind something and was attracting them. Even if food is in a bag like pretzels etc...they can still smell it and will keep coming back."

They arrived on Tuesday, I set them up, and on Wednesday morning I had TWO dead mice in my kitchen...  Holy cow, talk about effective!I've bought mousetraps like this before, but that one was (a) more expensive, and (b) a lot heavier-duty.  Taking them out of the package, they seemed to be made of plastic and a lot lighter duty than the old metal ones I bought and have since lost.  I thought for a moment that they wouldn't even be able to kill a mouse!BOY WAS I WRONG.A six-pack for this price is FANTASTIC.  What a deal!  The traps clearly work — no muss, no fuss, no mousey guts to clean up — and they have some nice features to them too.Reading other reviews, I did exactly as others did.  I took out the little bait compartments — how handy is not having to put your fingers INSIDE the trap to load it up? — put in a little bit of peanut butter — the little barrel takes very little, something I was ALSO worried about for NO GOOD REASON — and added a piece of cereal (Tim Horton's Apple Fritter to be specific).  I had to break the pieces into quarters to get them to fit, but that's another point in the product's favour, if you ask me: you don't have to use very much bait at all...Squeeze the back to prime the trap and put it on the floor facing the wall or a junction between counter and major appliance (oven and fridge in this case) and away you go.  Set it and forget it.  I woke up to TWO dead mice in the morning when I thought there'd only be one!  One of the traps had flipped over so I was staring at Mickey's belly while Minnie was showing me her back, but they were dead as doornails.Hold the trap over a garbage bag, squeeze the back, and out fall the mice.  RIP little guys (or gals).  I thought about adding photos of the late rodents to the collection of other images other reviewers have posted, but I wanted those little squeakers GONE so I didn't bother.  Into the trash they went.The traps are currently reset and once again in the kitchen — and with six of them, I've got more than enough if a whole gang decides to drop in — and while I hope I don't see another mouse, I'm fully confident that these traps will take care of 'em.The choice couldn't be simpler: buy these traps if you need to kill some mice.  You won't regret it.  Just remember that peanut butter helps hold the solid bait in place so the poor mouse HAS to really get in there to get their last meal, and the smell probably invites them in."
"43","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Great unit for household","BKW","Reviewed in the United States on 12 March 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Bought couple of model in the past but this one is the best ever. Very easy to load the food in the cup and ultra easy to arm the unit. I am up to 15 catchs after only 2 month, 1 trap in the house and 1 in the shed so they are catched outside before they get the idea to get in the house at fall. You want to get rid of the annoying beast, go for this model. The price for the qty of traps you get is excellent. I gave a couple to friends since I don't need that much who came in the box. Excellent bought, highly recommend."
"44","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Works very well","PMC","Reviewed in Canada on 16 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I had some concerns about this trap and why I’m giving 5 stars:1. Reliably - it has caught mice without fail when the trap goes off.2. Durability - it’s a hard plastic so I thought it couldn’t last. 1 trap has caught 7 mice and still sets just fine. I expect these to last many years inside my garage.3. Humanely kill - last night I hear a trap go off. The seconds it took check it, mice was dead.4. Function - very easy to bait and set. My main traps (and highest kill count) on each side of the garage door don’t need to be baited with how well these go off.5. Sanitation - as noted above, these have been instant kills. Mice don’t suffer and defecate all over the place (like glue traps). Another plus is the animal doesn’t get punctured nor squished (snap traps). At 10+ kills the past month, I’ve yet need to clean anything besides discarding the mouse."
"45","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Very effective solution to Rodent Problem! Thanks! ;-P","Niray","Reviewed in Canada on 18 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","These traps are effective and easy to use. We are being inundated with constant RAIN lately (suspect some geoengineering is responsible), and it is driving mice into our living quarters. UGH! So far with these ingenious little traps, I have caught FOUR invasive varmints and I just ordered another half-dozen of the traps, in case more of these unwanted guests appear! I also bought one of the electronic-zapper traps and it worked right away, but I decided I'd rather get lots of these small, inexpensive traps and just discard trap and rodent carcass in one fell swoop. So I only used the battery-operated zapper once; and I've used these small plastic traps several times. I like how easy it is to bait them and then ""cock"" them so they are all set to go when the hungry mouse sticks its head into the trap! On other (wooden) traps in the past I have come close to damaging my fingers on their spring-loaded devices, so I find these traps much safer and easier to use. I will continue to use these efficient, inexpensive traps should the need arise, but I really hope the rains will stop and the mouse invasions will soon be a distant, unpleasant memory! Many thanks for the ones who invented these clever little devices."

I immediately cursed them and was going to toss them, but I decided to give them another try. This time I put less peanut butter so that it is further down into the cup and I moved them back from the wall a little. Many other traps say to put them along the wall because that's where they travel, but that causes them to approach the trap from the sides. Moving them back from the wall means the mice will circle and come in from the front.I immediately caught 2 mice.And the good things about these traps is that all you have to do is pick it up then drop the mouse into the bin and you're good to reuse.Now to get in touch with the company that ""mouse-proofed"" my house."
"47","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","A better mousetrap","MonetLover","Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've used these on and off for years when and where mice were a problem. I first found them as a Dollar Store item, and the pricing of these is actually less than their price a decade and a half ago.These work better than sticky baits, which deal a pretty horrible death leaving the victims to suffer. Poison baits lead to an agonizing death, and leave their bodies to rot where you cannot reach them. They're a definite step up from traditional wooden traps. I bait them with peanut butter. They do kill...if you're prepared to accept that, these work. They aren't messy, they kill instantly, and you also don't have to handle the victims. Use them in areas in the routes where you see their leavings. They're as good a solution as you can get for something unpleasant."
