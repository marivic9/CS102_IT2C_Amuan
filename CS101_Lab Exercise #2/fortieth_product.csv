"6","ThermoPro TP55 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer",NA,"steven","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","It has a touch screen which is really nice, size yes it's small but I have it on the desk next to me so distance isn't a problem.  If you want something for distance such as 10 plus feet you can see it if you have decent eyesight but it could be difficult for some.  It's just really nice compact, feels and looks like quality.  No complaints."

"8","ThermoPro TP55 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer",NA,"Todd Henrigillis","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","We have a very expensive Carrier 'smart' thermostat that consistently overstates the temperature and understates the humidity.  It caused our humidifier to be over-used and made the house too moist.  Unfortunately, I did not get these meters in time to beat the expiration of the thermostat's warranty, but the technician was able to 'fool' it to do less humidification.  Side by side these meters agree 99% of the time."
