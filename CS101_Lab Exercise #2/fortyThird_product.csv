"1","Bamworld Wood Plant Stand",NA,"Sara","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I’m pleased with this purchase, although it’s somewhat more fragile than I would have liked.  I’ve loaded it with my plants and it looks great.  I placed it near the (floor to ceiling) window in my living room where the plants can “sunbathe” all day.  The living room has wall-to-wall carpeting the small casters are somewhat difficult to maneuver on the carpeted surface."
"2","Bamworld Wood Plant Stand",NA,"Kelsey","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Yes I purchased two of the plant stands that arrived yesterday and I put them together this morning. No tools were needed except the little mallet that they include and it was nice that they also included a pair of gloves for your hands. It was easy to put together, and seems sturdy enough for a dozen house plants. I was very pleased that there were a couple of extra pieces included in case something was cracked or broken. I was pleasantly surprised that they were exactly as advertised and I think they will suit my purpose. Perfectly good job I did buy the ones that had the casters , so that I could keep the rack up off my deck and be able to move the plants as needed."
"3","Bamworld Wood Plant Stand",NA,"DavaoJoe","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I love that it has easy instructions and video(if needed). You can also combine another tower to this and build a bigger display."
