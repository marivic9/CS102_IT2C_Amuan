When the water is drained it’s so easy to store, it’s flexible, it does not kink and its fittings are great quality. The spray trigger is variable and super smooth as well as having all the usual spray settings. It expands and shrinks as described. I’ve been using it for a few weeks in 35+ degree heat and it’s holding up great!"

"12","TheFitLife Expandable Garden Hose Pipe - Multi Core Latex and Solid Metal Fittings 8 Pattern Spray Nozzle AU Standard Expanding Kink Free Easy Storage Flexible Water Hose (25FT/7m)",NA,"Donna Lantrip",NA,"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I haven't used this item yet and I'm disappointed. I haven't had a hose for a long time and I was looking forward to using this product. However, the fitting supplied to attach to the tap is too small so now I have to find a bigger fitting from the local hardware store. I do have to say, the taps in my house were installed in the '60s so may not be the standard size used today. Still, I hope to soon have some fun cleaning the cat's litter trays with this hose.P.S. Please disregard the above review. It was written by a man who doesn't read instructions (a male tradition in my family). Found how to get the correct fitting for the tap, it works, and starting tomorrow I'm going to have some fun!"

We bought this for use in a smaller part of our garden & I was somewhat sceptical. 🤔 It exceeded what I expected & has so far been great, the hozzle/spray seems of good quality. 👍The tap fittings though are certainly not what is used in Australia (see images), they are way too small. 😬 It didn't matter as we already had the correct brass tap connector. ✌️Considering the process I would have doubts that it would have a long life but then it cost little. 💰Only time will tell but I love it. 😛"

La llevamos usándola desde hace más de un año y muy contento con ella puesto que no ocupa nada de espacio ni pesa ya que al dejar de recibir agua se contrae. Viene muy bien como es mi caso para el campo regar sitios lejos sin tener que usar una manguera común de agua la cual para otra vez ponerla en su sitio o llevarla a otro lado pesa y se tarda tiempo. Los conectores de metal te aseguran que no se pasarán con el sol o que se partirán si se golpean con algo y se pueden adaptar a rosca de ½ y ¾ lo cual está muy bien. La pistola es muy cómoda de usar y de regular la cantidad de agua que sale ya que cuenta con una palanca para regularla y los distintos chorros de agua le aportan mucha utilidad para distintas ocasiones en los que se use.Hay que tener en cuenta que necesita por los menos unos 3 o 4 bares de presión para que se expanda bien por lo que en una casa donde la presión del agua sea común puede no estirarse del todo.Tiene muy buena calidad ya que después de tantos usos y de arrastrarla por el suelo no se ha desgastado ni picado ya que esta totalmente a la intemperie."

"254","Indoor Thermometer Hygrometer Humidity Time Monitor Large LCD Display with Alarm Clock",NA,"kennyd1gital","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"Digital hygrometers are nothing new to me; I use them in several areas throughout my home. What is new, however, is having one with such a large, easy to read display. I can easily read the display on the LICHI Digital Hygrometer from across the room. I’ve also not previously used a digital hygrometer with a backlit display. The backlight is activated by a capacitive touch sensor at the top of the frame and makes it easy to read the large display in low-light or no-light conditions. The daily high and low readings for humidity and temperature are a great added feature and one you won’t typically find on the average budget digital hygrometer. The feature set rounds out with a low battery indicator (which is another thing you won’t find on other simple digital hygrometers), so you know when it’s time to replace the batteries (it takes three AAA batteries) well before the display goes blank. The only way I was able to test it for accuracy was to compare it to the readings on other hygrometers I own, but it was always in agreement with the others when I checked it while conducting this test; it seems to be accurate from what I am able to determine.Using the LICHI Digital Hygrometer is simple and intuitive. Really, you just put batteries in and it starts doing what you need it to do right away, which is display the current humidity and temperature (although you should give it several minutes to stabilize before considering the current reading accurate). There are three buttons on the back for clearing the stored daily high/low values, changing from ºF to ºC and vice versa, and resetting the unit to the factory default setting. Another feature I appreciate is the option to either mount the unit to the wall via the keyhole slot in the top rear of the frame, or having it rest on a shelf, countertop, or other flat surface using the integrated pop-out stand. The stand is spring-loaded to the open position, so there’s very little chance of it toppling over from bumps against the surface it’s resting on; it’s sturdy.Overall, I find the LICHI Digital Hygrometer to be an excellent choice when it comes to monitoring temperature and humidity throughout the home. While simple in design, it still offers a nice set of features that sets it ahead of the other digital hygrometers I own. If you are in need of temperature and humidity monitoring, I would definitely recommend this product!"

Keeping the temperature and humidity dialed in is crucial for several of the birds I raise. This is a simple and easy to use unit that requires no set-up. Simply add batteries and it's good to go. It is quite accurate for both temp and humidity and updates every few seconds. The backlit feature (turns on with a touch sensor at the top of the unit) is great for checking it in the dark without disturbing the birds too much, and it makes it simple to read, even for my old and nightblind eyes! I love that it also shows the highs and lows, so that I can see at a glance if my temp or humidity has gotten out of desired range. At less than $15, this unit is also a great value. Highly recommend!!"

This 'thermometer' does that quietly and effectively.  It will record the temperature range (high/low) for whatever period you are interested in.  This can be especially handy if there is some question if the heating/cooling equipment in an area may not be performing correctly.This also has a hygrometer (humidity) register that also provides high/low reading for the same place.  This is also of interest to me in that in the winter, the indoor humidity levels can drop.  Very low (or high) indoor humidity can be damaging to wood furniture and even the wood structure of a home/building.There are handy 'reset' and F/C buttons on the back.  The reason I say they are handy is that while you may be doing periodic resets of this measuring device, the other button is typically a setup operation and would not be used regularly afterwards.The actual device has a black rim around the face.  The display is the grey displays that you find on many LCD displays.  The back of the device is a white - not bright white though.  There is a pull out 'easel' that is on the back if you want to stand it up.  It will also operate laying down as long as you lay it on a hard surface (it needs air flow to do the measurements).The overall size is comparable to a smart phone."

The large font and lit background (need to pressure a light bulb icon on the top) makes it easy to read.  Although, I wish the lit surface would stay longer than 10 seconds.  It’s powered by 3 AAA batteries which are not included in the packaging.The unit measures changes in humidity and temperature very responsively.  I took it from room to room to test the temperature differences and to the bathroom after showering to test the humidity level.  I will use it primary to test the humidity in the bathrooms in order to prevent mold growth.  I do this by using a timer on a floor fan to blow dry.  This unit is very good for telling me how long to leave the floor fan on so the bathroom humidity can be lowered to a safe target %.In the winter time I intend on using it in the office to see if I need a humidifier before getting into trouble with dry skin and nose bleeds.  For the price it’s actually a very useful and elegant looking device. I would recommend it."

None of the readings match up. But I do feel the Hygrometer is the most accurate. The display is big enough to see from across a small room and it was very easy to setup. What I appreciate the most is the fact the hygrometer actually uses AAA batteries. No USB cord needed to charge and no built in non-removable rechargeable batteries used. I know that may sound anti-eco/green but I think devices like these should last well beyond the lifetime of built in rechargeable batteries. It would have been a shame to throw the entire unit out just because I couldn't replace the battery. And of course I can still used rechargeable AAA batteries as well. Overall happy with the purchase but I may get a different unit just to judge the accuracy of the readings."

Most of the time, I just forget about them until it shows up again.  This one shows what I need - the temperature and humidity of my living room, which doesn't have the best vents from my central air.  It's also where my hoard of plants remain during the winter months, so making sure the humidity is good means a lot to me.  Not only will it benefit my plants, it will also help me decide if I need a different humidifier.It seems to be quite sensitive because if you pick it up and hold it with just your fingers, your body heat affects the humidity and temperature reading almost immediately.  This gives me more comfort in believing that the readings are accurate.The only thing I can do without is the averages.  I don't have much use for the lowest or the highest of each reading.  Oh, and the little smiley face that's on it.  Honestly, it's beyond unnecessary.  What's comfortable according to the emoji isn't what everyone else will or won't think is comfortable."

"404","Super Ninja Fruit Fly Trap - 4 Traps - Highly Effective Ecological Fruit Fly Traps Indoor - Environmentally Responsible Fruit Fly Killer - User Friendly - Up to 3 Weeks per Bottle","Best of all product","Sharleen Holmes","Reviewed in Australia on 11 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've made homemade fruit fly traps to no avail. This product really works! My refrigerator went out and leaked underneath, just enough to provide a breeding ground for these nasty critters. And they must have found other places, because they just kept coming and coming, in droves. I tried all sorts of remedies and finally I found these. I bought one and within days, it was literally filled with insects, so I bought another one. In a couple of days that was full, as well. I now have 3-4 strategically placed and the difference it's made is enormous. I went from literally hundreds of these fruit flies to almost none in just over a week or so. I mean, I had so many that I literally couldn't even eat a meal, even in the living room. I was killing 15-20 of them in an evening. People said to spray alcohol on them - that did nothing. Cider vinegar did nothing. This is the only thing that worked and I can't recommend it enough. $5 might seem pricey for the tiny bottle you get, but it's well worth the peace of mind you get in return when you're not battling swarms of fruit flies and know they're dying in that little bottle on the counter! I'll keep using these until they're all gone and keep a few on hand for any future outbreaks. I figure once the population thins out enough, they'll breed less and eventually they'll be gone. Finding out where they're still breeding is the remaining thing I have to do, but in the meantime, I feel like I've gotten my house back from them!UPDATE: I've been using these things for months. I can't find where these things are breeding, but I'm going to be looking for a new product. The last few I purchased just don't seem to be attracting the fruit flies like the previous batches. I've also noticed that some bottles are darker than others and some are filled with more liquid than others. I'm not sure if they're being watered down or what, but the last couple batches were not as effective and don't seem to be attracting the fruit flies. Plus, when I first started purchasing them the price was $4.99 per bottle. Then I saw some for 4 bottles for $11.99, but before I could order them the listing disappeared. Then the price went up to $6.99 for one bottle, but there was also a listing for 2 bottles for $7.99 (those were the batches that were weaker and not as effective). Now I see the price is up to $7.99 for just one bottle! I think that's pretty high, considering the last few batches I purchased weren't strong enough to attract the fruit flies. Very disappointed in the change in effectiveness and higher prices."

Auch wenn die preislich etwas teurer als z.B. die klebenden Fruchtfliegenfallen von DM sind, ist diese Falle super wirksam. Die Falle haben wir direkt in der Küche neben unserem Obst aufgestellt. Nachdem diese dort 1 Tag stand, waren wir etwas enttäuscht, da noch keine Fliege sich für diese Falle interessierte.

Unfortunately my neighbours are scruffs and don't empty the kitchen bins after themselves.This left an opening for hundreds of fruit flies. It was that bad they were getting inside the cupboards, in the fridge, and in my room.So I purchased just one of these and stuck it the wall close to the kitchen. It had a sweet smell of vinegar which attracts the midgies.For the 1st day I thought it wasn't working as I didn't see and fruit flies going near it. But the second day.. Loads. So now instead of them sneaking through the gaps in my door, they were going for this.I can't stop the scruffy neighbours from being lazy but I can stop the flies from entering where I don't want them.This little bottle last a long time.

I decided to give them a shot, and boy, was I in for a surprise!The traps are supposed to last about three weeks, and guess what? They delivered exactly as promised. I set one up, and within a short period, it started to work its magic. It caught so many flies, it was like a ninja stealthily taking them down one by one. I was both amazed and grossed out by the number of little buzzers it managed to trap. Eww, fruit flies, you've met your match! I totally forgot about one of the traps I had set. It stayed in my kitchen for way longer than it should have. When I finally stumbled upon it, let me tell you, it was a sight to behold. The flies that were caught in that trap had turned into some kind of bizarre, melted fly art.Of course, at that point, the trap had done its job and was no longer catching any more flies, as one would expect. I'm buying more of these Super Ninja Fruit Fly Traps. They proved their effectiveness, and I'm ready to tackle any future fruit fly invasions with my trusty ninja traps."

Schon kurz nach dem Aufstellen fliegen die ersten Fruchtfliegen hinein! Das Abtrocknen des Trichters ist zu empfehlen, da die Fliegen sonst erst auf dem Trichter sitzen, bevor sie hinein fliegen. Der Lockstoff wirkt sehr gut und er stinkt überhaupt nicht! Erst wenn man direkt an der Öffnung riecht, riecht es angenehm nach süßen Äpfeln und leicht nach Essig. Ansonsten riecht man die Falle nicht. Da sich bei mir die Fruchtfliegen vor allem im Mülleimer vermehren, habe ich die Falle außen an den Mülleimer geklebt. Sie hebt sehr gut. Ich werfe sie nach Gebrauch nicht weg. Der Trichter lässt sich leicht entfernen, dann kann man die Falle gut reinigen und mit gekauftem oder selbst gemachtem Lockstoff neu befüllen. Mein selbst gemachter Lockstoff ist zwar nicht ganz so gut wie der original von SuperNinja, er wirkt aber trotzdem ganz gut. Für meinen selbst gemachten Lockstoff nehme ich Apfelsaft mit einem kleinen Schuss Apfelessig und 1 winzigen Tropfen Spüli."

The spray for insect Reid didn’t work at all. I sprayed it and next day there was again like 15 fruit flies. So I tried and bought this product, hoping it’ll help but didn’t have a massive expectation. Anyway, I opened it and next day a realised that I don’t see them flying around very much, one or two here and there and I look at the bottle and I was shocked to see how much flies were in it ! Yuk! I read they like fruit vinegar so I poured apple cider vinegar to small cups just little bit is enough and put the little sticker traps inside a cup and also cought a lot. Cheaper than this little bottle but this product is smarter looking and not as obvious as you don’t have a look at dead flies haha. I highly recommend this , I will be buying more to have in stock ."

I’m inundated with fruit flies (thanks Ocado for the rotten bananas fresh they were not!) anyway put one down near the cat food, cleared all surfaces, put one on other side of kitchen, one in the hall and one in the lounge.  Hall one seemed to catch a few, kitchen one a few but the one near the cat food - BAM that thing is completely rammed full of dead fruit flies.  Cats happy and I am happy too.The ones elsewhere are catching them but there aren’t as many.  I considered emptying a bottle and reusing it after but that thing is so full of dead flies I’m not going near it.  Expensive as they might be they 100% work so makes them entirely worth it.I will continue to battle with the wee beggers till they’re all gone.  Honestly, I’m gonna get more of these to have ready for the next time Ocado send me rotting fruit - maybe I can charge them to cover the cost!"

My preference is to open the window and usher them out but overnight they seem to be some kind of SAS Ninja fruit flies that sneak back in and hide in an invisible part of my kitchen and appear the following morning!I've tried the sticky catchers and although they catch a few, they are nowhere near as effective as this little bottle. It's discreet, inoffensive and a superb little buy. I've stuck it next to the compost bin and the huge reduction in the little blighters is evident.It took a couple of days (no idea why) but it's captured quite a few now. It's been stuck on there for a good few weeks now and the adhesive is strong and it's stayed put. I'll be replacing it with a fresh one soon."

I use the “food” pair to handle cooking meat, for example turning over any meats in the a slow cooker, or roast in an oven. Also used to serve salad at the table. And of course it works extremely well to pick up food & place on dishes, & I’m thinking about things that are unusual shapes and such: corn on the cob, asparagus, etc. Now, of course the tool needs to be cleaned & sanitized very carefully before using it on the next item in your recipe, especially both pork & chicken, etc.As far as non-food uses, I use them to make it easier to reach things, usually my glasses under furniture, or packaged food on the top pantry shelf. Actually, pretty much the “high shelf” in any kitchen cabinet, & maybe anywhere, requires me to use tools to reach. (I’m not even a hint taller than 5’ even.) I’ve been known to bring a pair to the grocery store.Quick recap: wonderful tool. Most recent design is genius. So many uses! You’ll love it!"

They are sturdy , you can tell they are quality made , they grasp the object (food) great , are easy to hold with the super grip handles , love the color red which I ordered and the locking design is great. It's like I thought all tongs were the same , I was so wrong these are so much better than my old ones that I had for like 100 yrs. ! Even my husband commented on these as he cooks on the grill, he stated that these have a great grip unlike our old ones and loves the locking mechanism which is so easy to use , a simple push and they are locked , snap and unlock how easy is that? They are easy to clean and you won't cut yourself as the tongs have more rounded edges not sharp but still have a great grasp at picking up any size or shape of foods , desserts, and great for grilling. I definitely recommend this set of 2 tongs because they are awesome and work great and SO well worth the low cost."

I really liked the choices of color grips; I got the turquoise set which is much more desirable than only having black as a choice. I like my automobiles in black. I wish they made a 3rd size which is smaller but was happy to find these. I use them indoors as well as on my Kamado grill outdoors.

"701","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Hernan","Reviewed in Australia on 13 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Long hoses are such a pain; the 22.5m version of this hose is a joy in comparison to a standard hose. No kinks, no tangles. Only drawback is I have to attach the pressure washer when it is at its short length, then attach hose & turn water on so the hose will “grow” & then I carry it all to where I need to be. Well worth it for the headaches this hose has solved."
"702","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"The Murrays","Reviewed in Australia on 2 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Once assembled and turned on, the hose began to quickly grow in size as if it were alive. When turning the hose off, it shrank again to it's original size, making it quicker and easy to put away. The material feels soft and flexible. The gun that came with it feels high in quality, with no leaks and multiple spray options. I found the shower option a bit too powerful for my plants, so I swapped it for my old gun. The overall look and feel of the hose is both stylish and functional."

"706","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Amazon Customer","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","When you try it off it needs to be drained, that's what the instructions say. It takes about 10 to 15 seconds to drain holding the lever on the sprayer. The other option, if your in a hurry,  is to take the sprayer off but be careful water spurts out just as if you still had it turned on. Other than that its great, no heavy plastic to carry and being 65 that's a winner in itself. Once my neighbours, 65 to 76, saw it they wanted one to. I also got one for my son and son in law."

But very happy so far no leaking. Longevity the only question I have at this stage.  But price was good. Just hope it lasts long enough to not add to the planet’s rubbish problem.UPDATEStill going strong. Very happy with this hose. Fittings have stiffened up a bit but no leakage. It’s been left outdoors in elements for more than 18 months so very satisfied. I was thinking of getting another longer one but seems to have increased significantly."
"741","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Hernan","Reviewed in Australia on 13 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Long hoses are such a pain; the 22.5m version of this hose is a joy in comparison to a standard hose. No kinks, no tangles. Only drawback is I have to attach the pressure washer when it is at its short length, then attach hose & turn water on so the hose will “grow” & then I carry it all to where I need to be. Well worth it for the headaches this hose has solved."
"742","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"The Murrays","Reviewed in Australia on 2 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Once assembled and turned on, the hose began to quickly grow in size as if it were alive. When turning the hose off, it shrank again to it's original size, making it quicker and easy to put away. The material feels soft and flexible. The gun that came with it feels high in quality, with no leaks and multiple spray options. I found the shower option a bit too powerful for my plants, so I swapped it for my old gun. The overall look and feel of the hose is both stylish and functional."

"746","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Amazon Customer","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","When you try it off it needs to be drained, that's what the instructions say. It takes about 10 to 15 seconds to drain holding the lever on the sprayer. The other option, if your in a hurry,  is to take the sprayer off but be careful water spurts out just as if you still had it turned on. Other than that its great, no heavy plastic to carry and being 65 that's a winner in itself. Once my neighbours, 65 to 76, saw it they wanted one to. I also got one for my son and son in law."
"747","Garden Hose Expandable",NA,"Gregory Hynds","Reviewed in Australia on 13 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","This is one of those rare gadgets you find on Amazon that's actually amazing. It really does get 3 times as big when it fills up and then shrinks when you release the water. This is more convenient than you'd think and makes me wonder, why are we not using this everywhere? The fittings are high quality and the black and brass looks great. It's day 1 for me, not sure if it's durable but it's very good out of the box. If this thing lasts more than a year, then it's great value."

To get a replacement from the company that manufactured it would have cost approx £40, so not worth it as that wasn't far off the cost of the whole item. I was really pleased to find the Aisitin solar fountain pump and panel especially as the kit included a length of clear tubing which I needed to feed the water from the pump to the top of my water feature. Also there is no connecting part - it is wired straight from the panel to the pump so nothing to go wrong there. Works really well even if not bright sunshine so very pleased.

Pump works instantly when sunlight hits the solar panel. However, it must be in full, direct sunlight. I tried to install it in sunlight that is filtering through a large Crepe Myrtle tree, it will not work. Just make sure there is absolutely nothing between the sun and the solar panel, and it's an awesome little pump. This is not a solar panel that charges up with sunlight. It will only work during direct sunlight hours, as there is no battery being charged by the sun. Great pump for daytime use. Suction cups on bottom to hold pump in place, and includes clear tubing to pump the water further away if you want to hide the pump, and not place nozzles directly on top of the pump."

"1223","AISITIN Solar Fountain","Great Value","Ingrid","Reviewed in Canada on 5 February 2024","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Years ago I bought a solar cascade water fountain, The solar panel and pump were in two separate sections and stopped working due to a fault with the connecting part. To get a replacement from the company that manufactured it would have cost approx £40, so not worth it as that wasn't far off the cost of the whole item. I was really pleased to find the Aisitin solar fountain pump and panel especially as the kit included a length of clear tubing which I needed to feed the water from the pump to the top of my water feature. Also there is no connecting part - it is wired straight from the panel to the pump so nothing to go wrong there. Works really well even if not bright sunshine so very pleased. Had to secure tube with peg to pump as seemed to be a bit loose but otherwise is fine. Great value!"

That was until it died 5 months later, RIP Helen.I assumed I just bought a faulty product and never hesitated to purchase the 2023 model.

After explaining the closing of season they extend the warranty as to allow me time to use the unit. THAT IS AWESOME SERVICE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING FROM THEM.

On the 4th time I thought it did not run that long, before the battery died. I hooked it up to charge and it just continually beeped and the lights went through flashing various colors (bluish white, green, red). Finally after 3 days tried again and it started charging. I put back in the pool and it started working maybe 10 minutes before it stopped. So I brought it back out checked it and restarted it. It then would kick in move a foot and stop. This went on several times. I took it out and let it drain and was going to see if needed charging. I plugged it up and lights and beeping continually. Now it will not work.

We have an above ground Bestway pool (12x20) and the month of July is typically a battle against algae. We purchased this in June and I’m glad we did! Typically we would have to completely vacuum the pool 3x/week minimum to keep the algae at bay, on top of regular chemicals, brushing the sides, etc. This robot is doing the job of that vacuuming. It is simple to use, holds a charge for 90 minutes, and comes with a hook for fishing it out of the pool. Once charged, you simply submerge it in the water, hold the power button down until the lights turn on, and once you see the water flowing through, you let go. It will run a grid across the pool for 90 minutes (more than enough time to clean our entire pool), and it will seek the edge when battery is low. When you’re done you simply rinse the filter and interior, allow it to dry, and throw it back on the charger. We have been using it daily, as long as chemical level isn’t too high. You want to check your chemicals before running this in your pool- if they’re in the “ideal” range, toss it in. If they’re above, don’t run it, as the high chemical content can erode the components. We now have a much more manageable routine of brushing sides before running the robot, and our pool is crystal clear this year. Hands down I would purchase this again, and highly recommend it. One note- this product is specifically recommended for above ground pools- if you have a built in pool,  you want the model higher than this one that can climb the walls. Honestly genius product, well made, and does the work of traditional vacuuming."

Typically we would have to completely vacuum the pool 3x/week minimum to keep the algae at bay, on top of regular chemicals, brushing the sides, etc. This robot is doing the job of that vacuuming. It is simple to use, holds a charge for 90 minutes, and comes with a hook for fishing it out of the pool. Once charged, you simply submerge it in the water, hold the power button down until the lights turn on, and once you see the water flowing through, you let go. It will run a grid across the pool for 90 minutes (more than enough time to clean our entire pool), and it will seek the edge when battery is low. When you’re done you simply rinse the filter and interior, allow it to dry, and throw it back on the charger. We have been using it daily, as long as chemical level isn’t too high. You want to check your chemicals before running this in your pool- if they’re in the “ideal” range, toss it in. If they’re above, don’t run it, as the high chemical content can erode the components. We now have a much more manageable routine of brushing sides before running the robot, and our pool is crystal clear this year. Hands down I would purchase this again, and highly recommend it. One note- this product is specifically recommended for above ground pools- if you have a built in pool,  you want the model higher than this one that can climb the walls. Honestly genius product, well made, and does the work of traditional vacuuming."

I told everyone that my little pool vacuum was a superhero. It fought pool dirt while I floated… well worth it. That was until it died 5 months later, RIP Helen.I assumed I just bought a faulty product and never hesitated to purchase the 2023 model. I read the the great reviews and was super excited to have another superhero be able to do the dirty work for me.  I have run the new vacuum 3xs and there is still debris at the bottom of the pool. In all fairness, the pool hasn’t been vacuumed most of the winter, but it is also screened in! The new 2023 model doesn’t get the corners, can’t go up my small incline and the deeper end still have debris. As you can see in the pictures, it’s not a huge pool. I really wanted to love this, but I don’t.Pro:-Love the new look and the power button on the top of the 2023.-It was nicely packaged-Was excited to see it came with extra parts.The price was $299 and I was able to purchase it for $200, not a bad price.-customer service is exceptionalCons:-Only cleans the deeper end.-Can not go up the 2-3” incline.-Doesn’t go up the sides or get the corners.- Even though the look has improved, the quality has decreased.Unfortunately, I’m going to return it. $200 for a vacuum that only cleans 45% of the pool isn’t practical.I would love to see if the next model up is better quality but it’s not in my price point at the moment.I guess I’m going to have to fight pool dirt and crime alone."

They reached out to me again this past week to FOLLOW UP and make sure I was happy and the 2nd unit was working. After explaining the closing of season they extend the warranty as to allow me time to use the unit. THAT IS AWESOME SERVICE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PURCHASING FROM THEM. I HAVE NEVER HAD SERVICE LIKE THIS. I WOULD GIVE THEM 10 stars if I could!!!!So confused. I have troubleshooted and can not find any info out on this product. I loved it for the 4 times I used it. On the 4th time I thought it did not run that long, before the battery died. I hooked it up to charge and it just continually beeped and the lights went through flashing various colors (bluish white, green, red). Finally after 3 days tried again and it started charging. I put back in the pool and it started working maybe 10 minutes before it stopped. So I brought it back out checked it and restarted it. It then would kick in move a foot and stop. This went on several times. I took it out and let it drain and was going to see if needed charging. I plugged it up and lights and beeping continually. Now it will not work.

"1851","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Easy to Use and Work Great For Price!","Linda Gordon","Reviewed in Australia on 24 January 2024","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I was skeptical as there are always people who give bad reviews. But I was also desperate. I live in the country so occasional mice are an issue but this seems to be an infestation larger than normal. Poison wasn't working - probably poisoning one mouse but not the batch. I liked the look of these for easy set up and because they were re-usable. The traps came this afternoon. I only set up 2 of the 6 from the pack. Super easy. Within one hour of setting it up (while I was sitting in the same room!) the trap went off and I had my first mouse. Disposed of it in 2 seconds and took another 2 seconds to re-set the same trap. I didn't even need to rebait it. Within another hour and a half (still sitting in same room) I had my second mouse (same trap). These do the job and even if they do konk out after a few uses it will be worth the money as they are cheap for the price.  One note - I used a VERY tiny amount of peanut butter (like half a  pinky nail in size and put it down deep in the bait bowl. Don't pile it up or use a lot as it gives the mouse the ability to possibly eat and retreat without setting anything off. By putting it down in the cup he has to reach his head in there for it. Likewise, don't avoid the cup and put it back further in the trap....the bait bowl seems designed to make sure their neck is in line when it closes. If you put the bait too far back in the trap you may not catch its neck so use as directed, I will definitely buy these again if I need them!!!!Update - still working great. Still using same 2 traps. 4 mice caught so far by these traps (3 in one trap, 1 in another) and I haven't had to re-bait either trap yet. I don't know why I wasn't using these all along so much faster and more effective than poison!Update 4/16 - 1 year later and still going GREAT!  I have still only used 2 traps out of the entire pack. The springs are still working fantastic and they are just as lethal as when I bought them a year ago so WELL worth the price!!!  They continue to work after more than a year, and I still have spares if/when I need them. There is no blood or mess so the traps don't get gross. This is a clean kill to the skull or neck. I just toss the dead mice out and reset - and occasionally refill the little bait cup with fresh peanut butter. If these are not working for you then you are not setting them in the right place. I have two different types of mice getting in because I'm in the country. Normal ""house"" mice and lighter brown field mice. These traps have long since exterminated the regular house mice so they worked to get rid of this type 100%....but then I started getting field mice. I think they found a way into my sunroom from the outside wall. At any rate. At first, the traps would not catch them, and were even going off at times w/o catching anything. The trap would be snapped closed - but no mouse. I quickly realized these new mice were coming and going in a different part of the room. The place I had set the traps that worked on the house mice was not ideal anymore because the paths they were moving along were different. So I moved the traps to where I saw and heard the activity. Now these same two traps are catching field mice like gangbusters. I went from catching 2 mice a day to every other day to now only once every 1-2 weeks so I am sure I'm getting this infestation under control as well.  If you know you have mice but are not catching anything try these tips:  1. Put the trap against something like a box or a baseboard so that it is parallel to that object. Do not set them out in the open. Mice like to keep to the walls for safety and feel exposed if they are in the open. The traps that do best for me are always the ones where the trap is set right against a vertical surface like a wall or a box so that the mice encounter it while running along their ""safe"" paths.  2. If the traps keep going off but you are not catching anything there are two possibilities. One - you have rats not mice and the traps are too small. Two - they are not getting far enough into the trap and are able to jump free when it triggers. One solution to try is to only put a tiny bit of peanut butter way down inside the bait cup rather than over-filling the cup with a huge hunk of peanut butter. Using less makes them have to reach further in to get the bait. Less is more. Also...remember to refresh the peanut butter occasionally. It gets dry and crumbly and fresh stuff works best. My mice don't last long enough to eat the bait so I eventually have to clean out the crusty peanut butter and put in new stuff. Then the traps start catching mice again.  3. TIP: Remove all sources of food from the area or put it in plastic bins. I figured out what caused my two infestations. I had a bag of granola bars that had fallen behind something and was attracting them. Even if food is in a bag like pretzels etc...they can still smell it and will keep coming back."

The traps clearly work — no muss, no fuss, no mousey guts to clean up — and they have some nice features to them too.Reading other reviews, I did exactly as others did.  I took out the little bait compartments — how handy is not having to put your fingers INSIDE the trap to load it up? — put in a little bit of peanut butter — the little barrel takes very little, something I was ALSO worried about for NO GOOD REASON — and added a piece of cereal (Tim Horton's Apple Fritter to be specific).  I had to break the pieces into quarters to get them to fit, but that's another point in the product's favour, if you ask me: you don't have to use very much bait at all...Squeeze the back to prime the trap and put it on the floor facing the wall or a junction between counter and major appliance (oven and fridge in this case) and away you go.  Set it and forget it.  I woke up to TWO dead mice in the morning when I thought there'd only be one!  One of the traps had flipped over so I was staring at Mickey's belly while Minnie was showing me her back, but they were dead as doornails.Hold the trap over a garbage bag, squeeze the back, and out fall the mice.

You won't regret it.  Just remember that peanut butter helps hold the solid bait in place so the poor mouse HAS to really get in there to get their last meal, and the smell probably invites them in."

Reliably - it has caught mice without fail when the trap goes off.2. Durability - it’s a hard plastic so I thought it couldn’t last. 1 trap has caught 7 mice and still sets just fine. I expect these to last many years inside my garage.3. Humanely kill - last night I hear a trap go off. The seconds it took check it, mice was dead.4. Function - very easy to bait and set. My main traps (and highest kill count) on each side of the garage door don’t need to be baited with how well these go off.5. Sanitation - as noted above, these have been instant kills. Mice don’t suffer and defecate all over the place (like glue traps). Another plus is the animal doesn’t get punctured nor squished (snap traps). At 10+ kills the past month, I’ve yet need to clean anything besides discarding the mouse."

"1861","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Easy to Use and Work Great For Price!","Linda Gordon","Reviewed in Australia on 24 January 2024","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I was skeptical as there are always people who give bad reviews. But I was also desperate. I live in the country so occasional mice are an issue but this seems to be an infestation larger than normal. Poison wasn't working - probably poisoning one mouse but not the batch. I liked the look of these for easy set up and because they were re-usable. The traps came this afternoon. I only set up 2 of the 6 from the pack. Super easy. Within one hour of setting it up (while I was sitting in the same room!) the trap went off and I had my first mouse. Disposed of it in 2 seconds and took another 2 seconds to re-set the same trap. I didn't even need to rebait it. Within another hour and a half (still sitting in same room) I had my second mouse (same trap). These do the job and even if they do konk out after a few uses it will be worth the money as they are cheap for the price.  One note - I used a VERY tiny amount of peanut butter (like half a  pinky nail in size and put it down deep in the bait bowl. Don't pile it up or use a lot as it gives the mouse the ability to possibly eat and retreat without setting anything off. By putting it down in the cup he has to reach his head in there for it. Likewise, don't avoid the cup and put it back further in the trap....the bait bowl seems designed to make sure their neck is in line when it closes. If you put the bait too far back in the trap you may not catch its neck so use as directed, I will definitely buy these again if I need them!!!!Update - still working great. Still using same 2 traps. 4 mice caught so far by these traps (3 in one trap, 1 in another) and I haven't had to re-bait either trap yet. I don't know why I wasn't using these all along so much faster and more effective than poison!Update 4/16 - 1 year later and still going GREAT!  I have still only used 2 traps out of the entire pack. The springs are still working fantastic and they are just as lethal as when I bought them a year ago so WELL worth the price!!!  They continue to work after more than a year, and I still have spares if/when I need them. There is no blood or mess so the traps don't get gross. This is a clean kill to the skull or neck. I just toss the dead mice out and reset - and occasionally refill the little bait cup with fresh peanut butter. If these are not working for you then you are not setting them in the right place. I have two different types of mice getting in because I'm in the country. Normal ""house"" mice and lighter brown field mice. These traps have long since exterminated the regular house mice so they worked to get rid of this type 100%....but then I started getting field mice. I think they found a way into my sunroom from the outside wall. At any rate. At first, the traps would not catch them, and were even going off at times w/o catching anything. The trap would be snapped closed - but no mouse. I quickly realized these new mice were coming and going in a different part of the room. The place I had set the traps that worked on the house mice was not ideal anymore because the paths they were moving along were different. So I moved the traps to where I saw and heard the activity. Now these same two traps are catching field mice like gangbusters. I went from catching 2 mice a day to every other day to now only once every 1-2 weeks so I am sure I'm getting this infestation under control as well.  If you know you have mice but are not catching anything try these tips:  1. Put the trap against something like a box or a baseboard so that it is parallel to that object. Do not set them out in the open. Mice like to keep to the walls for safety and feel exposed if they are in the open.

I took out the little bait compartments — how handy is not having to put your fingers INSIDE the trap to load it up? — put in a little bit of peanut butter — the little barrel takes very little, something I was ALSO worried about for NO GOOD REASON — and added a piece of cereal (Tim Horton's Apple Fritter to be specific).  I had to break the pieces into quarters to get them to fit, but that's another point in the product's favour, if you ask me: you don't have to use very much bait at all...Squeeze the back to prime the trap and put it on the floor facing the wall or a junction between counter and major appliance (oven and fridge in this case) and away you go.

You won't regret it.  Just remember that peanut butter helps hold the solid bait in place so the poor mouse HAS to really get in there to get their last meal, and the smell probably invites them in."

Reliably - it has caught mice without fail when the trap goes off.2. Durability - it’s a hard plastic so I thought it couldn’t last. 1 trap has caught 7 mice and still sets just fine. I expect these to last many years inside my garage.3. Humanely kill - last night I hear a trap go off. The seconds it took check it, mice was dead.4. Function - very easy to bait and set. My main traps (and highest kill count) on each side of the garage door don’t need to be baited with how well these go off.5. Sanitation - as noted above, these have been instant kills. Mice don’t suffer and defecate all over the place (like glue traps). Another plus is the animal doesn’t get punctured nor squished (snap traps). At 10+ kills the past month, I’ve yet need to clean anything besides discarding the mouse."

I like how easy it is to bait them and then ""cock"" them so they are all set to go when the hungry mouse sticks its head into the trap! On other (wooden) traps in the past I have come close to damaging my fingers on their spring-loaded devices, so I find these traps much safer and easier to use. I will continue to use these efficient, inexpensive traps should the need arise, but I really hope the rains will stop and the mouse invasions will soon be a distant, unpleasant memory!

"1881","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Easy to Use and Work Great For Price!","Linda Gordon","Reviewed in Australia on 24 January 2024","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I was skeptical as there are always people who give bad reviews. But I was also desperate. I live in the country so occasional mice are an issue but this seems to be an infestation larger than normal. Poison wasn't working - probably poisoning one mouse but not the batch. I liked the look of these for easy set up and because they were re-usable. The traps came this afternoon. I only set up 2 of the 6 from the pack. Super easy. Within one hour of setting it up (while I was sitting in the same room!) the trap went off and I had my first mouse. Disposed of it in 2 seconds and took another 2 seconds to re-set the same trap. I didn't even need to rebait it. Within another hour and a half (still sitting in same room) I had my second mouse (same trap). These do the job and even if they do konk out after a few uses it will be worth the money as they are cheap for the price.  One note - I used a VERY tiny amount of peanut butter (like half a  pinky nail in size and put it down deep in the bait bowl. Don't pile it up or use a lot as it gives the mouse the ability to possibly eat and retreat without setting anything off. By putting it down in the cup he has to reach his head in there for it. Likewise, don't avoid the cup and put it back further in the trap....the bait bowl seems designed to make sure their neck is in line when it closes. If you put the bait too far back in the trap you may not catch its neck so use as directed, I will definitely buy these again if I need them!!!!Update - still working great. Still using same 2 traps. 4 mice caught so far by these traps (3 in one trap, 1 in another) and I haven't had to re-bait either trap yet. I don't know why I wasn't using these all along so much faster and more effective than poison!Update 4/16 - 1 year later and still going GREAT!  I have still only used 2 traps out of the entire pack. The springs are still working fantastic and they are just as lethal as when I bought them a year ago so WELL worth the price!!!  They continue to work after more than a year, and I still have spares if/when I need them. There is no blood or mess so the traps don't get gross. This is a clean kill to the skull or neck. I just toss the dead mice out and reset - and occasionally refill the little bait cup with fresh peanut butter. If these are not working for you then you are not setting them in the right place. I have two different types of mice getting in because I'm in the country. Normal ""house"" mice and lighter brown field mice. These traps have long since exterminated the regular house mice so they worked to get rid of this type 100%....but then I started getting field mice. I think they found a way into my sunroom from the outside wall. At any rate. At first, the traps would not catch them, and were even going off at times w/o catching anything. The trap would be snapped closed - but no mouse. I quickly realized these new mice were coming and going in a different part of the room. The place I had set the traps that worked on the house mice was not ideal anymore because the paths they were moving along were different. So I moved the traps to where I saw and heard the activity. Now these same two traps are catching field mice like gangbusters. I went from catching 2 mice a day to every other day to now only once every 1-2 weeks so I am sure I'm getting this infestation under control as well.  If you know you have mice but are not catching anything try these tips:  1. Put the trap against something like a box or a baseboard so that it is parallel to that object. Do not set them out in the open. Mice like to keep to the walls for safety and feel exposed if they are in the open. The traps that do best for me are always the ones where the trap is set right against a vertical surface like a wall or a box so that the mice encounter it while running along their ""safe"" paths.  2. If the traps keep going off but you are not catching anything there are two possibilities. One - you have rats not mice and the traps are too small. Two - they are not getting far enough into the trap and are able to jump free when it triggers. One solution to try is to only put a tiny bit of peanut butter way down inside the bait cup rather than over-filling the cup with a huge hunk of peanut butter. Using less makes them have to reach further in to get the bait. Less is more. Also...remember to refresh the peanut butter occasionally. It gets dry and crumbly and fresh stuff works best. My mice don't last long enough to eat the bait so I eventually have to clean out the crusty peanut butter and put in new stuff. Then the traps start catching mice again.  3. TIP: Remove all sources of food from the area or put it in plastic bins. I figured out what caused my two infestations. I had a bag of granola bars that had fallen behind something and was attracting them. Even if food is in a bag like pretzels etc...they can still smell it and will keep coming back."

"1893","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Great unit for household","BKW","Reviewed in the United States on 12 March 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Bought couple of model in the past but this one is the best ever. Very easy to load the food in the cup and ultra easy to arm the unit. I am up to 15 catchs after only 2 month, 1 trap in the house and 1 in the shed so they are catched outside before they get the idea to get in the house at fall. You want to get rid of the annoying beast, go for this model. The price for the qty of traps you get is excellent. I gave a couple to friends since I don't need that much who came in the box. Excellent bought, highly recommend."
"1894","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Works very well","PMC","Reviewed in Canada on 16 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I had some concerns about this trap and why I’m giving 5 stars:1. Reliably - it has caught mice without fail when the trap goes off.2. Durability - it’s a hard plastic so I thought it couldn’t last. 1 trap has caught 7 mice and still sets just fine. I expect these to last many years inside my garage.3. Humanely kill - last night I hear a trap go off. The seconds it took check it, mice was dead.4. Function - very easy to bait and set. My main traps (and highest kill count) on each side of the garage door don’t need to be baited with how well these go off.5. Sanitation - as noted above, these have been instant kills. Mice don’t suffer and defecate all over the place (like glue traps). Another plus is the animal doesn’t get punctured nor squished (snap traps). At 10+ kills the past month, I’ve yet need to clean anything besides discarding the mouse."
"1895","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","Very effective solution to Rodent Problem! Thanks! ;-P","Niray","Reviewed in Canada on 18 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","These traps are effective and easy to use. We are being inundated with constant RAIN lately (suspect some geoengineering is responsible), and it is driving mice into our living quarters. UGH! So far with these ingenious little traps, I have caught FOUR invasive varmints and I just ordered another half-dozen of the traps, in case more of these unwanted guests appear! I also bought one of the electronic-zapper traps and it worked right away, but I decided I'd rather get lots of these small, inexpensive traps and just discard trap and rodent carcass in one fell swoop. So I only used the battery-operated zapper once; and I've used these small plastic traps several times. I like how easy it is to bait them and then ""cock"" them so they are all set to go when the hungry mouse sticks its head into the trap! On other (wooden) traps in the past I have come close to damaging my fingers on their spring-loaded devices, so I find these traps much safer and easier to use. I will continue to use these efficient, inexpensive traps should the need arise, but I really hope the rains will stop and the mouse invasions will soon be a distant, unpleasant memory! Many thanks for the ones who invented these clever little devices."
"1896","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","They Work Great & Are Reusable","Max Som","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","The first time I put one of these out, I came back to find the peanut butter gone and the trap unsprung. I immediately cursed them and was going to toss them, but I decided to give them another try. This time I put less peanut butter so that it is further down into the cup and I moved them back from the wall a little. Many other traps say to put them along the wall because that's where they travel, but that causes them to approach the trap from the sides. Moving them back from the wall means the mice will circle and come in from the front.I immediately caught 2 mice.And the good things about these traps is that all you have to do is pick it up then drop the mouse into the bin and you're good to reuse.Now to get in touch with the company that ""mouse-proofed"" my house."
"1897","Feeke Rat Trap, Large Mouse Traps, Mouse Traps Indoor for Home","A better mousetrap","MonetLover","Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","I've used these on and off for years when and where mice were a problem. I first found them as a Dollar Store item, and the pricing of these is actually less than their price a decade and a half ago.These work better than sticky baits, which deal a pretty horrible death leaving the victims to suffer. Poison baits lead to an agonizing death, and leave their bodies to rot where you cannot reach them. They're a definite step up from traditional wooden traps. I bait them with peanut butter. They do kill...if you're prepared to accept that, these work. They aren't messy, they kill instantly, and you also don't have to handle the victims. Use them in areas in the routes where you see their leavings. They're as good a solution as you can get for something unpleasant."
